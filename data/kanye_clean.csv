yssbfm,https://www.reddit.com/user/scooobsmama,1,"Like I said I have bipolar too and get it from a different angle I dont mean that to sound dismissive its just that heres the POV from another person thats been through mania The most common reason for stopping meds in this illness is your brain tricking you into thinking you are normal and dont need meds  The issue is its literally the meds working thats keeping you stable so once that is interrupted and episode is likely to begin 
It sucks taking meds I frequently cry about having to be bound to a pharmacy just to function Its easy to listen to that voice telling you that you dont need them anymore God forbid anyone in his circle is telling him to stop them because once my mom and a friend of mine separately said they dont think I needed pills/maybe wasnt bipolar but just stressed from my situation from when I was manic I stopped my meds and deteriorated
Bipolar truly feels like a superpower If ANYONE in my circle egged on my delusions it immediately made it 10x worse It made me believe my grandiose thinking I almost made some awful financial and social situations too The longer youre in psychosis the more your brain chemistry is eroded and it becomes harder and harder to listen to reason Hes very very sick and his fame is whats killing him because he functions as a god in his mind and wont relent Id guess people profiting off of him are encouraging him 
Finally theres a possibility a med he took induced the episode via serotonin syndrome or just didnt agree with his brain For example I take Prozac now as an antidepressant but when they tried me on Zoloft it made me manic within days and I was just following the directions on the bottle 
Once again though bipolar doesnt make you racist or antisemitic thats just the unfortunate rabbit hole his brain took him down Ugh I bet he literally fell down the Q anon pipeline

BPD manifests a lot of different ways for everyone who has it 
Some people are able to live normal lives and have occasional really manic episodes that render them unable to do their normal routine (work any kind of job buy groceries do laundry care for their children etc etc etc) 
I will admit that it is treatable -- but tons of MPD patients agree to medication on one of the downswings of their episodes and then refuse to treat when they personally feel better (note: this is where Kanye has been a few times in his public life/career) 
Eventually it spirals out of control and they either rebound get help are assigned help against their will or just continue down the spiral 
Ye is on that final option above 
Its fairly obvious he needs serious help Dude has been in the deep end of the above equation for years and has only had one or two mild steps back towards normalcy which rarely lasted more than a dayfew orweeks/months weekat the verybest 
Shit like this is why a living will & power of attorney with a backup given to two people who I love and trust This kind of signing away of rights can be incredibly useful / lifesaving for people with mental illnesses Or even just people with concerns about their mental or physical states

If you all think the Movie and music industry doesnt drug and compromise people then head on down to Hollywood and try to get into the business
I was used by them since the age of 11 Adrenochrome isnt a get high drug for the Elites it is a mind control drug used on people they want to compromise  It is made from human endocrine brain chemicals extracted from the Pituitary and Pineal glands
They use it for method acting and for mind controlled sex slaves
Created in the early 1950s by the CIA in the MKULTRA program
The info on the drug was shared with a few A list actors who then started using it in Hollywood and in the music industry
Many of the performers are given it for performing the brain chemical that activates the adrenal glands is the one used for performances on stage as it gives them energy to perform
I was used as a MKULTRA by the CIA and by people in Hollywood and the music industry
The CIA controlled anybody who gains influence in Hollywood they are compromised by sex videos with under age boys or girls at higher levels they are drugged and made to kill on video and this is used as a threat for them to keep their mouth shut or else 
You are all so brain washed it is pathetic

The reason they poked the eyes and scraped the negative on that photo of me on the ground was to cover up it being me and to cover up my eyes being black and me being on their mind control drug 
You pupils become enlarged like if you were on Acid which might be one of the components they used with Endocrine gland chemicals Adrenochrome is not a youth elixir the the rich use it is a mind control drug 
This is why I told Ye to be very careful as they will try and dope him up and if they have a handler around him to program him he could end up killing somebody and no clue what took place after 
It is much scarier than you could imagine They have people in all facets of life who are part of the cabal/secret society Bush Sr Told me they took over America when they started taxing property using the States which is against the constitution 
What it means is America stopped being a free country and they own all the land Stop paying your property tax and they can take your home and land It is exactly what our ancestors ran away from to come to America which was a free country at the time 
Have you ever heard the expression If you know you know Well that means they know the US Government is a crime syndicate and elections are all rigged 
Trump is as much a part of it as Biden and they all do what they are told They keep the house and senate as close to 50/50 as possible because it allows them to block any bills and pass any bills their owners want 
It would be almost impossible to divide the country 50/50 every voting cycle yet for the past 50 years its been that way only time it was a majority was when Obama was in and that was done purposely to pass laws the conservatives didnt want to be a part of due to their supporters would stop supporting them if they voted to pass them
At the age of 11 they used me to infiltrate the Mafia at 13 I was used to kill Nelson Rockefeller via poisoning Bush Sr made a deal with David who wanted to make sure his brother didnt run for president as he had planned David wanted control and he promised Bush the presidency then he screwed Bush over putting Reagan in saying the people liked him more A month into office Bush has Reagan shot I was used to shoot Brady not Reagan that was who Hinckleys target was 7 shots only 6 bullets if you listen to the audio  
When I was 15 I was sent to Iran to rescue the diplomats the movie Argo is about me what wasnt told in the movie is when they left me and them it was done purposely What it meant is all those people I was rescuing would die A deal was made to expose a rescue mission in exchange those military who were given the info would get us out for details of the mission  
This made a lot of cabal members very angry and I became a target after but had enough friends inside to help me get out of the shit I was framed for They had many reasons to want me dead just a few of them mentioned above 
They control everybody in the industry and they have videos on those in office which they get before placing them into office
I have been the only one to go against them and expose them who has survived

If Kanye wasnt so popular and people like you didnt buy sweaters for 150$ then adidas COULD NOT sell Yeezys for 150$ Because this might sound crazy but it no one buys something but hat means you cant sell it 
But Since people like you exist People who are willing to spend 150$ for a sweater for what Why did you spend 150$ on the yeezy one and only 60$ on the mac Miller one when by your own comment theyre essentially the same So why did you buy the double the price yeezy one Because its yeezy Because Kanye 
So if youe adidas A company that needs to make money Are they going to let those shoes sell for 50$ when you KNOW that 100% without a doubt someone like you will come along and pay 150$ for them Youre really just going to leave 100$ on the table No thats just bad business

The second key factor for the shoe firm in the early 1930s was the role sport played in the racial-nationalist philosophy of Hitler With the rise of the National Socialist German Workers Party athletic teamwork was prioritized The Dassler brothers did not fail to see how their economic interest would benefit from politics; all three Dassler brothers joined the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933three months after Hitler was appointed Chancellor
But it was Adi who decided that becoming a coach of and supplier to clubs in the Hitler Youth movement was essential to expanded production and he joined in 1935
Dassler became a frequent house guest of Martz who permitted Dasslers attentions to his fifteen-year-old daughter Kthe Martz On 17 March 1934 the two wed (She was 16 he was 33)
In the early years of the war the firm was partially converted to a factory for the production of military material [] But it still continued to produce Waitzer shoes although some of its football line became known as Kampf and Blitz
Adi was declared a Belasteter the second most serious category of Nazi offenders which included profiteers and subjected the convict up to 10 years in prison
Both Adi and Rudolf were members of the National Socialist Motor Corps and in their correspondence both used the complimentary closing Heil Hitler

The assumption with name brand recognition is that the realtion to something popular will spur sales What these new shoes sell without Kanyes name attached willl be based on their own merit Those who bought Kanyes shoes no longer have incentive to buy them

Do you think Kanye will ever bounce back from everything thats happened recently

He could easily bounce back Hed need to take his meds enter therapy come out the other side showing hes developed some level of reasoning and common sense and he can rebuild his brand to doem level of good standing 
The only thing in question would be his ability to create art Kanye once claimed he couldnt do so on meds but Id wager he didnt try that hard and was just used to the energy inspiration from his manic episodes Even then Kanyes exact skill at producing has been variable over the last several years anyway Id wager if he could just maintain that same level of some people appreciating it and others not hed be fine

*sigh*  
yes comments were born from pent-up frustration w/ shady businesspeople   
yes butthurting the businesspeoples feelings by going after their religion by implying shit  
at the time when ye sent out the tweet that started it all ye finally snapped and said fuckit and let out his blurb of butthurt feelings   
everyone needs to realize that babies are not born anti-semites okay people are taught to hate from shitty experiences  
u guys getting it now  
u guys need to understand that his comments although seemingly anti-semitic dont stem from hate of jews but from hate of shitty people that took advantage of him  
these other youtube comments are coming from ppl that are probably stuck in their house and have been stuck in their house all their life or just have also had shitty experiences with people that happened to be jewish or shitty upbringing  
either way the commonality between ye and these commenters is shit experience   
what needs to happen is that we ALL AS HUMANS need to more than just defame and shoot down shitty views okay we need to more than shaaaaaaaameee got it  
we as HUMANS need to be the GOOD EXAMPLES easier said than done ya i kno   
heres a start: provide a dam solution after ur criticism (this is the hardest part (no sarcasm))  
we as a people are judging only YE ok  
IT TAKES 2 TO TANGO  
Ye is not solely responsible here who the fuk prodded him to this point Hmmmm   
u think he just woke up one day and was like i feel like causing some fukd up shit later tonight on twitter  
no   
the other ADULTS that were making SHITTY BUSINESS DEALS with YE thought they could get away with YET ANOTHER VICTIM OF BUSINESS DEALING like AAALLL THE OTHER HUNDREDS (THOUSANDS) OF PEOPLE these businesspoeple screwed over  
they fukd with the wrong camel cuz now yes backs broken and hes emotionally crying out in pain  
but YE is at fault TOO as the ADULT  
he should have said/done something as the ADULT if he felt something was wrong w/ the deals he was taking/making  
but he pushed his feelings way deep down and now has blown up into a tantrum   
back to the solution-providing part:
try this PRETEND UR U U JUST SAID ALL THIS ANTISEMITIC SHIT WHAT WOULD U TELL U AS A SOLUTION AFTER UR DONE SHAMING URSELF

You should also know there is not one but two different Talmuds each spanning multiple volumes And furthermore the Talmud is not even the final say in religous texts and argumentation far from it actually  Shulchan Aruch Mishnah Torah Any of these ringing a bell at all  If not then you are not even remotely qualifed to be commenting on Jewish religious texts (My qualification to comment is a literal degree in religious studies ) This doesnt even go into the hasidic texts or the more contemporary (19th and 20th) century texts Mordchai Kaplans writing alone spawned and entire branch of Judaism with its own rabbinical university and everything

I said to him Simon you are telling a lie Bauer recalled in an interview Tuesday He said Sometimes you need to do that to get the results for things you think are essential
Bauer and other historians who knew Wiesenthal said the Nazi hunter told them that he chose the 5 million number carefully: He wanted a number large enough to attract the attention of non-Jews who might not otherwise care about Jewish suffering but not larger than the actual number of Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust 6 million

Youve quoted nothing but Jews Now Jewish sources are unreliable Lmao
The 6 million figure was not pulled out of thin air There were internal reports There were ledgers They were specific and detailed
There were meeting notes where people discussed the logistics and relative benefits of using gas-vans vs gas chambers There were diaries and letters from people running the camps There were formal requests for permission to temporarily halt the killing so that corpses could be burned - the bodies in their mass graves had swelled in the heat and overflowed and the runoff had contaminated the well-water
Killing that many people was a complex and difficult task involving the cooperation of thousands The paper trail was incredibly dense And you can pick through it yourself - its all out there readily available

Those was population numbers from around the world Wild baby boom they had to have roughly the same global population before during and after the Holocaust
And prior I quoted accomplished authors who sold stories as true accounts only to later admit they were exaggerated or completely fabricated Take away from that what you will

The paper trail was incredibly dense And you can pick through it yourself - its all out there readily available

Its not Its physically impossible to do what was described after the fact especially during the tail end of losing the war and there is no hard proof of what you claim Meanwhile I can show you doctored invoices created after the fact to support your theory Theres been a lot of reconning after the fact

You are trying to push a narrative that the Holocaust

did not kill as many Jews as currently estimated and the deaths that did occur were mainly due to typhus outbreaks Zyklon-b is a poor instrument to kill people with in the best conditions

I might be able to help with the last bit at least
The Judaic people are thought to have originated in the Palestine region but there have been dozens of diasporas throughout history that have spread them across the world The Romans and Jewish Kingdoms warred heavily they were highly independent and resistant to being conquered When they were defeated after several bloody wars and sieges many were expelled or left to seek better fortunes as Jerusalem and the surrounding areas had been devastated Many were also taken as slaves of conquest back to Roman lands These migrations led to large Jewish communities in Egypt and eventually Ethiopia Over the years Jewish folks spread out acrossprimarily Europe and Africa and many intermarried with locals in their new homelands causing future generations to change appearance over time 
In Europe Jewish folk spread out further their migrations driven by the fact that they were often the scapegoat for regimes looking to divert attention away from their own misfortunes or as piggybanks to be raided when the crown needed more income These European migrations and intermarrying with regional peoples led to Jewish folk in Europe more closely resembling the European countries they migrated to than the 3000 year old tribes they were comprised of originally Of course African JewsJewish people also take after their homelands - European Jews arent the only ones to have diversified over timeBut the legacy of stolen land stolen wealth persecution and eviction remains Im not saying that the suffering of Jewish folks in history outweighs any other repressed and persecuted people by the way But this is also a big reason why jewish folk have often been allies in a lot of modern civil rights movements

 Real Jewish people have a bunch of those

Yeah you mean the ones they claimed to be theirs after taking over Israel after pagan Europeans en masse converted to Judaism Then pillaged all of Africa and destroyed as much evidence as they could of the black ancient Hebrews And why African languages have closer similarities to ancient Hebrew than Yiddish (currently spoken language in Israel) which is clearly a Germanic/Slavic language Give me a break 

Im Puerto Rican

Nah youre taking this so personally I just cant help but think youre Jewish or maybe have a Jewish wife or something Not that theres anything wrong with that I have no problem with Jewish people

They dont speak Yiddish they speak modern Hebrew show me the similarities with the African religionslanguages if they exist Samaritans (who arent black) preserved the ancient Hebrew script even more so than Jews

Nah youre taking this so personally I just cant help but think youre Jewish

Not at all I just think being a vulture and stealing another peoples culture is wack as fuck I mean I understand it more with Black America because their culture and identity has been taken but not by Jewish people

why African languages have closer similarities to ancient Hebrew than Yiddish

If you could really prove this I might even take your sideBut instead you have a ridiculous conspiracy where white europeans converted to Judaism to steal your identity and it sounds pretty stupid to most people

Simply the idea of WHITE and BLACK and so on is pretty recent Were the tribes in certain parts of the African continent enslaving those from other tribes because of white supremacy 1000 years ago Were the Celtic Germans and Gaules fighting and enslaving each other over white supremacy Do you know where the word slave comes from
What its really always been is very simply nobility and peasants Serfs and Plebs Thats it Were just fucking peasants regardless of skin color or culture or creed Were pitted against each other so that we dont have time focusing on the real oppressor 
The idea of race is a ridiculous construct of brainwashing that people have simply fallen prey Shit if you really wanna get into how weird segregation is based on race check out the Haitian revolution which lasted about 14 years Its so convoluted in how white or black a person was they had terms for people who were an 8th black which are considered racist today even though no one really remembers them

It is also possible that some Jews migrated northward from the Italian colonies on the northern shore of the Black Sea [9] All these Jews are likely the descendents of proselytes (converts)
The very high correlation (0926) between the genetic distances of EEJ and geographic distances when the latter are calculated from Rome also supports the origin of EEJ from Italy or its vicinity and not merely from the Mediterranean basin

24 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon and from Cuthah and from Ava and from Hamath and from Sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof

The tribe of Juda was not stopped in its migration westward by the sea; or perhaps when it was driven out from Egypt part of it moved to the West along the coast of the Mediterranean till it got round to Guinea (West Africa) and there it is yet with its native curly head possessing a beautiful country full of fine rivers among which are found a river Phrat and a Jachin It would be very curious to examine the language of this people Edrisi in the twelfth century says that Jews occupied the country on the river Lamlem and that it is called Yahani This is confirmed by Mr Bowditch in his account of the Ashantee country Every thing proves that they were of the tribe Judi though as they have no Pentateuch it is clear that they came not from the tribe of the Western Asiatic Judaea or at least that they did not emigrate from it after the time of Moses

Doctor Allen H Godbey reached the following conclusion: These factors have a very specific significance if we consider the presence of Judaism among the American Negroes Hundreds of thousands of slaves were transported to America from West Africa during the slave trade which started some 400 years ago What traces of Judaism still remained among the Negroes of West Africa at that period To the extent that they were persecuted they were more likely than other Negroes to be seized during wars and sold as slaves

 The (Samaritan) woman said to Him Sir I perceive that You are a prophet Our fathers worshiped on this mountain and yet you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship Jesus said to her Believe Me woman that a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know because salvation is from the Jews  But a time is coming and even now has arrived when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers God is spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth The woman *said to Him I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes He will declare all things to us Jesus said to her I am He the One speaking to you
The kind of Judaism youd find within Samaritanism is STILL vastly more comparable than anything youd find in western Africa

History has recorded the date and cause of the Israelitish immigration into West Africa after the destruction of Jerusalem

Most Jews fled throughout the world Many went to Alexandria Rome North Africa Babylonia   We have an overabundance of evidence for these things and the Jewish communities within them managed to survive for generations and generations 

Let us assume some Jews did manage to get as far as western Africa all that happened is they managed to COMPLETELY lose their religious identity  (Which is what happened with the tribe of Dan if you want the honest truth)  Ill grant you that a number of Jews wound up in west Africa at some point  But they either left assimilated completely or were persecuted out

I think youd also have to argue MOST Jews ended up in west Africa and THOSE were the ones that somehow managed to maintain their Jew status  You would also have to ignore the multitude of Jewish communities throughout the Mediterranean that maintain their Jewish traditions even to the point of persecution for generations  
Even you have to admit that the Jews that did exist in places like Sudan entirely lost their identity

You would then have to argue that all the Jews that managed to settle between Jerusalem being destroyed and Guinea being settled would have somehow been fraudulent Jews Even though they were the ones that managed to maintain Jewish culture and identity

Conversion to Judaism was common in Rome in the first centuries BC and AD Judaism gained many followers among all ranks of Roman Society [10-13]
Again Look at the words It says it was common and many Not the entirety or even majority

Nice try but no You are gaslighting The title of the article is literally: 
The origin of Eastern European Jews revealed by autosomal sex chromosomal and mtDNA polymorphisms
It is referring to ashkenazi (EEJ or eastern european jews) as a whole
In the background portion of the paper it literally says word for word:
The aim of this study is to establish the likely origin of this major Jewish population by using a larger dataset of autosomal markers and compare the results to analyses based on the available data for the X and Y chromosomes and for mtDNA
Referring to ashkenazi (eastern european jews) as a whole
In the results portion of the paper it literally says word for word:
According to the autosomal polymorphisms the investigated Jewish populations do not share a common origin and EEJ are closer to Italians in particular and to Europeans in general than to the other Jewish populations
Referring to ashkenazi or eastern european jews as a whole
The conclusions portion of the article literally says word for word:
The close genetic resemblance to Italians accords with the historical presumption that Ashkenazi Jews started their migrations across Europe in Italy and with historical evidence that conversion to Judaism was common in ancient Rome 
Again referring to ashkenazi (eastern european jews) as a whole
You claimed that it was only dealing with a subset of eastern european jews and that was a lie 

Not to mention your idea of needing to compare it to Abraham Isaac and Jacob is stupid They did not exist 

This is a cop out that people use when they cant refute the historical documentation that says the Jews/Israelites were black people who resembled black africans They didnt exist but their so-called descendants do People like you try to appeal to DNA without the actual DNA required to establish legitimate ancestry and when this is pointed out the progenitors all of a sudden never existed

The origin of Eastern European Jews

Yes its literally talking about Eastern European Jews Not Jews Like I said

It is reffering to ashkenazi (EEJ or eastern european jews) as a whole 

Thats literally what I said

The aim of this study is to establish the likely origin of this major Jewish population by using a larger dataset of autosomal markers and compare the results to analyses based on the available data for the X and Y chromosomes and for mtDNA

Again Its specifically talking about the Ashkenazi origin Not Jewish origin

and EEJ are closer to Italians in particular and to Europeans in general than to the other Jewish populations

Once again Like I said No people are pure And this is one study among hundreds

The close genetic resemblance to Italians accords with the historical presumption that Ashkenazi Jews started their migrations across Europe in Italy and with historical evidence that conversion to Judaism was common in ancient Rome

Again It is talking about Ashkenazi Jews

You claimed that it was only dealing with a subset of eastern european jews and that was a lie 

No I said one specific passage you cherry picked was talking about Ashkenazi Jews from the Black Sea

This is a cop out that people use when they cant refute the historical
This is a cop out that people use when they cant refute the historical documentation that says the Jews/Israelites were black people who resembled black africans

Because there is none You cant refute something that doesnt exist There are Black Jews But Jews are not BlackThere are White Jews Arab Jews Spanish Jews Black Jews etc And most of them share specific genetics that link them all to the Southern Levant (Israel)

They didnt exist but their so-calle descendants to

Romulus and Remus didnt exist so I guess Romans didnt exist Lol

Thats where I stopped reading

Maybe you should continue to then Here I suggest you read a collection of studies done
https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Genetic_studies_on_Jews
Genetic studies on Jews are part of the population genetics discipline and are used to analyze the chronology of Jewish migration accompanied by research in other fields such as history linguistics archaeology and paleontology These studies investigate the origins of various Jewish ethnic divisions In particular they examine whether there is a common genetic heritage among them
Studies of autosomal DNA which look at the entire DNA mixture show that Jewish populations have tended to form relatively closely related groups in independent communities with most in a community sharing significant ancestry For populations of the Jewish diaspora the genetic composition of Ashkenazi Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish populations show significant amounts of shared Middle Eastern ancestry According to geneticist Doron Behar and colleagues (2010) this is consistent with a historical formulation of the Jewish people as descending from ancient Hebrew and Israelites of the Levant and the dispersion of the people of ancient Israel throughout the Old World Jews living in the North African Italian and Iberian regions show variable frequencies of admixture with the historical non-Jewish population along the maternal lines In the case of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews (in particular Moroccan Jews) who are closely related the source of non-Jewish admixture is mainly southern European Behar and colleagues have remarked on an especially close relationship between Ashkenazi Jews and modern Italians Some studies show that the Bene Israel and Cochin Jews of India and the Beta Israel of Ethiopia while very closely resembling the local populations of their native countries may have some ancient Jewish descent
Sorry but the history anthropologicanthropology archaeology and scientific communities all agree most Jews are descendants of the Israelites Stop trying to appropriate another peoples identity and take pride in your own actual identity Its a little sad youre dishonoring your ancestors lives and sacrifices they madeby believing in a fantasy

Again its not an article Its a research paper
And yes you were misinterpreting it For one you think all Jews = Ashkenazi Two the article is studying how the ASHEKNAZI demographic came to be How is this so hard to understand Jews split off into different demographics You have three major ones Ashkenazi Sephardic and Mizrahi They all have to have some origin when they became distinct from each other No different than trying to figure out when one African group became distinct from another African group

If you were in agreeance that the article was talking about ashkenazi jewish people to begin with 

Thats not what you said You said modern Jewish people You were the one who didnt specifically say Ashkenazi and youre the one saying Jewish = Ashkenazi Ill even post what your article says
The work of Behar et al from 2008 was instrumental in creating the mtDNA matrix as can be seen in table table77 in Additional file 1 There was no need to cite it previously as it did not contain any genetic distance analysis that could further clarify the origin of EEJ
What did the Behar et al study say Well if you bothered to actually read the link I posted Ill show it again:
According to geneticist Doron Behar and colleagues (2010) this is consistent with a historical formulation of the Jewish people as descending from ancient Hebrew and Israelites of the Levant and the dispersion of the people of ancient Israel throughout the Old World Jews living in the North African Italian and Iberian regions show variable frequencies of admixture with the historical non-Jewish population along the maternal lines In the case of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews (in particular Moroccan Jews) who are closely related the source of non-Jewish admixture is mainly southern European Behar and colleagues have remarked on an especially close relationship between Ashkenazi Jews and modern Italians
Ill make this clear for you It is saying that modern Jews including Ashkenazi Jews are descendants of the Israelites and for thousands of years have varying degrees of mixture with their local non-Jewish populations as they spread throughout the world This is notthat difficult to understand

then you wouldnt have typed up that long-winded post trying to gaslight me

Btw the last time I checked romans/italians are caucasian people 

Lmfao You dont even know what the difference is Caucasian race is an outdated racist race theory from the 1800s The Caucus region is a literal region of the world where modern day Armenia and Georgia are And no if youre wondering Georgia is also the name of a country not just a state in the US
https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Caucasian_race
The Caucasian race (also Caucasoid or Europid Europoid) is an obsolete racial classification of human beings based on a now-disproven theory of biological race The Caucasian race was historically regarded as a biological taxon which depending on which of the historical race classifications was being used usually included ancient and modern populations from all or parts of Europe Western Asia Central Asia South Asia North Africa and the Horn of Africa
First introduced in the 1780s by members of the Gttingen school of history the term denoted one of three purported major races of humankind (those three being Caucasoid Mongoloid and Negroid) In biological anthropology Caucasoid has been used as an umbrella term for phenotypically similar groups from these different regions with a focus on skeletal anatomy and especially cranial morphology without regard to skin tone Ancient and modern Caucasoid populations were thus not exclusively white but ranged in complexion from white-skinned to dark brown
The Caucasus as the origin of humanity and the peak of beauty
In the eighteenth century the prevalent view among European scholars was that the human species had its origin in the region of the Caucasus Mountains This view was based upon the Caucasus being the location for the purported landing point of Noahs Ark  from whom the Bible states that humanity is descended  and the location for the suffering of Prometheus who in Hesiods myth had crafted humankind from clay*
In addition the most beautiful humans were reputed by Europeans to be the stereotypical Circassian beauties and the Georgian people; both Georgia and Circassia are in the Caucasus region The Circassian beauty stereotype had its roots in the Middle Ages while the reputation for the attractiveness of the Georgian people was developed by early modern travellers to the region such as Jean Chardin

I wasnt talking about the Jericho source I was talking about the one I just referenced (the one that says white jews were imported into israel from germany) 

Because Mizrahi Jews were of a brown complexion not black

(Black americans are not literally black just in case you were unaware) 
Oh so now mizrahi (egyptian) jews were in israel in 1880 Why didnt it just call them mizrahi jews or compare them to mizrahi jews Rofl 
Youre flat out lying at this point and its complete comedy Im really just toying with you 
The Jericho source that says the native west bank inhabitants were negroes with woolly hair is from 1867 -- 13 years before the source about the native Jews of of palestine resembling southern slaves in america 
You would love for everyone to believe that those two historical documents arent talking about the same people though and that one of them is instead talking about mizrahi jews

Prime example of somebody with cognitive dissonance trying to gaslight others

You think that Jericho was a city full of black people because of descriptions of dark skinned people with wooly hair lmao Karl Marx was described by black and white people as dark skinned with wooly hair Using your absurd logic Karl Marx is a black man Doesnt matter how many travelers noted that they had dark complexions of course they do Those same Europeans said Marx and Jewish people had dark complexions (and wooly hair) constantly
That alone refutes your bullshit
Where did all those black Palestinian Jews go from 1867 I need an explanation for how all these black Palestinian Hebrew Israelites disappeared out of thin air and replaced by brown Arabs and Jews
Mizrahi Jews are dark skinned with wooly hair

In Jericho not Palestine broadly How many times you need to hear this

Then the second source I presented confirms they were natives/Jews of Palestine

Not one point does it say Jews just says native inhabitants which at the time was mostly Muslim not Jewish

the 2 sources were written 13 years apart and they are both talking about the same people in the same location

They specified that there negro type in Jericho which hints that it wasnt the norm of the Muslims at the time In fact the only Afro-Palestinian populations that exist live in Jerusalem Gaza and oddly enough Jericho
https://travelnoirecom/history-afro-palestinians-past-and-present
There are mixed Bedouin African tribes in Jericho which is why they specified in Jericho You are trying to pretend they were talking about Jews
The community in Jericho exists because Africans came to work in the sugar industry during the times of the Umayyad

Ive also heard weird rumors about her wanting him to be under some type of conservatorship (even before Kanye said it during the divorce) which would be super fucked up if she wanted to control his behavior that way
On the other hand its widely known that Kanye was obsessed with Kims image The fact that he was calling her from a different city to criticize her outfit and then the fact that he also tried to stop her from wearing her met gala dress because its too revealing yet he put her in his music video naked on a horse

ypzjm6,https://www.reddit.com/user/FuckPrinevilleOR,1,"I enjoy a lot of the beats and instrumentals quite a bit but frankly its basically Kanye being a shitty person for an hour and only being convincingly villainous some of the time Most of the time its just annoying especially when hes singing which is way worse than anything on even 808s Frankly the features carry the project and it says a lot that the best moment on the album (the Nicki Monster verse) wasnt even a contribution from Kanye I could maybe understand the hype for this album if it was super influential and was more compelling topically but its mostly centered on Kanyes personal narrative which is only interesting if you can forgive him being an absolute jackass
Given recent events I think its aged kinda poorly and I think people should have taken songs like Runaway as a warning sign rather than cheering Kanye on for being awful to people (women especially see Kim and Taylor) Its not cool or deep to acknowledge your flaws if youre just gonna continue being awful if it were literally anyone else none of you would be foaming at the mouth calling it genius 
Also that Chris Rock sketch is fucking awful and you cant convince me otherwise
I personally cant enjoy Kanye anymore as of late but I would much rather listen to his first four records than ANYTHING he released afterwards (except maybe KSG) I could break down my feelings track by track but this is already long and I know this is gonna get downvoted to hell anyway

ypzjm6,https://www.reddit.com/user/GDubya527,1,"I appreciate you responding to this in the detail you did And while I agree that Nickis verse is the best part of the album that verse is as flawless as you get in hip hop And he managed to get another one on the album with Rick Ross verse on Devil in a new dress As a musician while I get Its HIS album I dont think its his job to have the best moment when youre rocking an all star cast of musicians across many different genres and lyricists He was the creator and conductor which shouldnt be diminished in an album with that level of detail 
And I agree that Ye is difficult to digest these days But you have to separate the music from
the musician If the music brought you joy those moments cant be taken from your memory
And I would say that he was clearly in a darker headspace with this album compared to the first four But I dont think its fair to say we would know exactly what would happen or shouldve been interpreting warning signs with our Pom poms put away

ypzjm6,https://www.reddit.com/user/FuckPrinevilleOR,1,"Your take on Nicki and the other features is fair enough If I look at the album more charitably I admire Kanye for making some of his biggest records more a celebration of hip hop with his guests and letting them shine I guess I just have a hard time putting much stock into that when I find Kanyes contributions annoying or straight bad (though in fairness theyre not ALL terrible the Gorgeous verses are still fire and so are the ones on Dark Fantasy amd POWER)
I have no problem with other people choosing to separate the art from the artist here but for me personally I have a difficult time doing that when the art displays what Im trying to separate the artist from I guess that doesnt necessarily apply to his first four records as much but like its really hard listening to tracks like Runaway or Famous because the sleazy energy matches Ye in real life then and now Whatever you or anyone else decide to do is completely valid though
And to be clear I didnt mean to imply that people shouldve seen the slavery comments and antisemitism and shit coming a Mikemile away based on songs like Runaway no one has a crystal ball What I meant to say was that in hindsight its a lot harder to stomach because hes literally telling you Hey Im a bad person and Im never gonna change Sometimes this angle can be pulled off really effectively on records like The Weeknds House of Balloons but as far as we know Abel is really chill and not very controversial in the real world Kanye is destroying his legacy hurting his loved ones and ruining his life to prove a point and its devastating to watch

So I ask you why are you saying these statements What is the productive conversation youre trying to have with these statements and questions 
And thats not what Jay z said He said all the real estate so an equivalent statement would be Jews own the banks and run the financial system because they own all of it Not: a lot of Jews are disproportionately represented in the New York City real estate market

This comment of yours puts everything into perspective Youre just incredibly ignorant on the matter
If you actually want to have this conversation about Jewish people and anti-Semitism you should really read up on it and learn how it started and learn why its such a big deal to the Jewish community when people reuse language that started the Holocaust
Thats why its such a big deal and thats why its not tolerated You should really read some of these educational papers you claim that exist that talk about Jewish people and relearn the history how anti-Semitism starts and why its bad for everybody involved

humanitarian documentation exists my guy

TLOP was one of the hugest albums as well as cultural moments of 2016 and the fact it wasnt nominated for best album of the year (although it did get the best rap album nod) was widely criticized by a number of mainstream publications
Ye was met with mixed responses by fans on initial release but again was generally well received and on multiple publications top album of the year lists
Kids See Ghosts was met with universal critical acclaim and helped revitalize Kid Cudis career
Jesus is King is a lackluster album although does contain a handful of highlights and is still Grammy nominated
Donda is very bloated but still has a shit ton of highlights It broke multiple streaming records for his listening parties and was one of the largest albums from last year

That being said everything is harder for him in terms of platforms not willing to promote his music media outlets covering it less favorably or not at all artists that likely wont want to associate- who knows if someone like james blake would want always to be released at this point Even sample clearances are harder bc it can sometimes come down to whether someone wants to give you the clearance to use their stuff or not bc they trust your artistry There could even be studio musicians who provide basic background instrumentals and dont even have their names on a project who dont want to work w himTheres a lot more and thats just in regards to music
Not trying to sound like im discounting ye himself/on his own but truly the pillar of his success has always been collaboration With other artists musicians producers- if you look at the yeezy brand it truly would be nothing without the designers he brought on like dingyun zhang greg ross etc and thats not even touching on the kind of manufacturing/infrastructural issues he could be facing now And hes built a lot of bad will in the industry bc hes been negatively affecting the jobs of people  who technically worked under the yeezy brand

Go complete radio silence and head to Hawaii Wyoming wherever he wants to for 12-18 months and dont tell anyone in the media that he planned to do this Do whatever it takes to get mentally right during this time
Media takes notice that hes gone on hiatus after a few weeks/months however Kanye continues to stay in silence No tweets no statements no features on other artists songs nothing
Slowly signal that he has grown and learned from his mistakes This could be silent donations to anti-hate groups appearances at Holocaust memorial centers etc However still no media interviews tweets or statements
Kanye brings in other artists that cut ties with him previously to work on his next project like Jay or Cudi to show that hes really trying to build back bridges 
He drops his first album/project and again makes it clear hes learned and understands the impact of what he did Im talking 4:44 or Ye (the album) level of self-criticism
Most importantly after it drops he goes back into silence and go to work on his next project This means no media rollout no SNL appearances or listening parties

BecauseI say this because the shit Kanye is saying is coming out of a place of paranoia(which stems from his mental state) and being in the wrong environments Im gonna be completely honest here I used to be homophobic It stemmed from hanging around the wrong type of people and it took leaving those people and exploring my sexuality to finally realize how that shit is wrong and being homophobic is bad I think a similar situation could potentially be the deal with Kanyes this time involving antisemitism

Not even just within the black community (where the NOI idologyideology already has a footing where distrust of the jews and white elites already exists) the notion that jewish people have a disproportionate amount of power within the entertainment industry was hardly even a controversial thing to say as recent as 10 years ago (the LA times had an op-ed on the very topic)
Couple that with the recent shit with Kyrie who was promptly suspended theyve  generated this weird media storm where being justly punished by having endorsements taken away gives the illusion of proving their point even when it isnt in actuality
But youre (figuratively) smoking some strong crack if you dont think Kanye can come back from this If Mel Gibson found his way back kanye can too
