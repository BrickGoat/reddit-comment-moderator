I understand the US is really bad versus Europe. But all evidence indicates that without the rights afforded by liberalism you would be fully at the mercy of politicians? Can you imagine that? Someone like Trump could ascend to be president of your single party socialist state, and then he cannot be removed?
Maybe you shouldn't try and push socialism, just work under democracy, it's a much better system. We have democracy in the UK and it doesn't stop us having universal health care. Because we have liberalism we also don't have slavery and racism like you see in socialist systems, there is no us versus them. Well, we do have some racism, for example there are even programmes and movements that seek to advantage non whites, these in truth are racist, but these are generally deemed as desirable and are the choice of the people (we have a lot of anti white sentiment in big cities due to a history of terrible racism all the way up to the 1980's).
You can't win hearts by seeking to reduce people's rights and freedoms and seizing functioning systems, reducing efficiency and output in the name of ""getting"" people you don't like.
The US desperately needs to change, I am not from the US and accept that to this end I do not fully understand it. This is just a view from the outside looking in.

Contrary to Adam Smith's, and many liberals', world of self-interested individuals, naturally  predisposed to do a deal, Marx posited a relational and process-oriented view of human beings. On this view, humans are what they are not because it is hard-wired into them to be self-interested individuals, but by virtue of the relations through which they live their lives. In particular, he suggested that humans live their lives at the intersection of a three-sided relation encompassing the natural world, social relations and institutions, and human persons. These relations are understood as organic: each element of the relation is what it is by virtue of its place in the relation, and none can be understood in abstraction from that context. [...] If contemporary humans appear to act as self-interested individuals, then, it is a result not of our essential nature but of the particular ways we have produced our social lives and ourselves. On this view, humans may be collectively capable of recreating their world, their work, and themselves in new and better ways, but only if we think critically about, and act practically to change, those historically peculiar social  relations which encourage us to think and act as socially disempowered, narrowly self-interested individuals.

Contrary to Adam Smith's, and many liberals', world of self-interested individuals, naturally  predisposed to do a deal, Marx posited a relational and process-oriented view of human beings. On this view, humans are what they are not because it is hard-wired into them to be self-interested individuals, but by virtue of the relations through which they live their lives. In particular, he suggested that humans live their lives at the intersection of a three-sided relation encompassing the natural world, social relations and institutions, and human persons. These relations are understood as organic: each element of the relation is what it is by virtue of its place in the relation, and none can be understood in abstraction from that context. [...] If contemporary humans appear to act as self-interested individuals, then, it is a result not of our essential nature but of the particular ways we have produced our social lives and ourselves. On this view, humans may be collectively capable of recreating their world, their work, and themselves in new and better ways, but only if we think critically about, and act practically to change, those historically peculiar social  relations which encourage us to think and act as socially disempowered, narrowly self-interested individuals.

Can verify anecdotally (neurodivergent af here). The very systems that exist don't accomodate us well, if at all. So we're much more prone to understanding flaws of a system. These systems can be as small as a dot of color outside the line in a coloring book or as big as a global economic system.

Contrary to Adam Smith's, and many liberals', world of self-interested individuals, naturally  predisposed to do a deal, Marx posited a relational and process-oriented view of human beings. On this view, humans are what they are not because it is hard-wired into them to be self-interested individuals, but by virtue of the relations through which they live their lives. In particular, he suggested that humans live their lives at the intersection of a three-sided relation encompassing the natural world, social relations and institutions, and human persons. These relations are understood as organic: each element of the relation is what it is by virtue of its place in the relation, and none can be understood in abstraction from that context. [...] If contemporary humans appear to act as self-interested individuals, then, it is a result not of our essential nature but of the particular ways we have produced our social lives and ourselves. On this view, humans may be collectively capable of recreating their world, their work, and themselves in new and better ways, but only if we think critically about, and act practically to change, those historically peculiar social  relations which encourage us to think and act as socially disempowered, narrowly self-interested individuals.

ykylq2,https://www.reddit.com/user/Catal1stic,-2,"Well, let's go down the list:
China: I think we can all agree that capitalist modes of production exist in the country. I assume we differ on what we see their purpose as. MLM views Deng Xiaoping's reforms as having both introduced capitalist modes of production and exchange as well as having paved the way for the establishment of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
Cuba: It's interesting as it definitely still has a dictatorship of the proletariat, but it seems that the rate of private property ownership is on the rise. And markets have begun to rear their ugly heads.
DPRK: Don't really know much about it. I think it still has a dictatorship of the proletariat, but I don't have much information about it from andan MLM perspective, other than perhaps a dislike of Juche by many MLMs. I have not formed a particularly strong opinion, but I suspect sooner or later I will read or learninglearn something that will explain to me why.
Laos: I don't know much about Laos,. theyIt'res rarely discussed anywhere in my experience. Not in ML or MLM spaces. So I really can't confidently say they are or aren't.
Vietnam: I personally am not keen on markets,  as I believe they recreate many capitalist relations, such as monopolies. So, in market socialism, you could have a worker coop monopoly, which, while it wouldn't be exploiting it's workers, would be exploiting consumers.
None of this is to say that these countries cannot restore socialist relations of production and exchange. Because, for all of them, a worker's state, whether a dictatorship of the proletariat or not, still exists in structure.
I think seeing the last few countries as AES depends upon your confidence in reformism. I am not very confident, but there are always opportunities to be proven wrong, and I sincerely hope that I am.
Edit: I am just providing my reasoning for why I think what I do. I am not here to bicker about what I think you should think.

Using 2011 as a base point, China's poverty line stands at 2,536 yuan per person per year, or 6.95 yuan per day. According to the 2011 PPP, one U.S. dollar was equivalent to 3.04 yuan, which means China's rural poverty line is actually equivalent to a daily income of approximately $2.30 – about 20 percent higher than the global standard of $1.90 [as defined by the World Bank]. - CGTN

There was a distinct absence of those feelings at the start of that ideological framework. Very bluntly, these people are not being forced to stay hateful because of people that don't want to tolerate intolerance - it's just that they're hateful. I don't think there's a legitimate situation where someone is a Nazi, and stays a Nazi because they're upset that their feelings are hurt by people that stand against them, and not that they just want to continue hating. 
That hate is taught, sure, you can be surrounded by it, emboldened and find a community in it. But there's many people that can be in those communities and still be empathetic, human people that don't end up falling back into hate. These ideologies are not baseline, centrist feelings, conservative or otherwise. These ideologies are built upon hate and oppression of those already marginalized in the broader community.

I think you might be surprised in the future. People have done worse, pettier things over far less important ideological differences. Sure, it's mostly anecdotal. Maybe the experience is an anomaly. Maybe.
Maybe people are a lot simpler than you are considering. I think we could all stand to benefit from listening a little more to who people actually are, and what they actually want, rather than what we think or what we perceive them as wanting. Sometimes what they say they want and are, could not be further from the truth.
I don't want you to think I'm trying to like argue with you or something. This has just been a level-headed and reasonable discussion over a topic that usually immediately goes to ""fuck off nazi sympathizer/bootlicker/etc."" So I'm just enjoying a positive discourse.

yibhth,https://www.reddit.com/user/Jj0n4th4n,51,"Well, the first thing is Lula was never a socialist, he is a union leader and his ideas were to improve labor conditions inside capitalism. 
For a bit of context, in 1961 was elected president Jânio Quadros a excentric figure not that far off from Bolsonaro, he was elected with support of the far right party UDN but his vice president was João Goulart ""Jango"" a left wing politician, at the time president and vice president were elected separated. In 1963 Jânio resigned and started the militar coup who would prevent Jango from governing, he was in China when he become president but was prevented from returning under threat of prison. Jango did had support from Leonel Brizola then govenor of RS and because of that he had a state to land safely but by the time he got back congress had turned Brazil into a parlament. Only in 1963 Brizola manage to a plebiscite would place Jango into office for real that is until a militar coup would take the country from 1964-1985.
The military was anticomunist and hate unions, Lula was arrested in 1980 due to the importance of ABC massive strike. Other union leaders were also arrested by the repressive arms of the dictatorship the DOPs. Many people who were taken to be 'interrogated' never returned so being in a union was very risk at the time.
As a president Lula did a lot, the minimun wage went from 200 R$ to 540 R$ and It had a 78% increase of value. His investiment on pre sal made Petrobras into a giant comparable to Exxon, that is extremely important because oil is an strategical resource and Petrobras had social goals, first by reducing oil domestic prices and later by investing royalties into public education and health. On education Lula was also very good, he did several social programs to allow the poor to get a college degree, and to get food. 
However there is plenty of criticism of Lula as well, first he didn't make the media democratization he had promised, Brazilian television is extremely centralized into the hands of three broadcaster, all which were giving by them in the militar dictatorship, Lula even lost one election due to Rede Globo blatant manipulation of debate between he and Collor. Another problem is he did nothing about banks exploitation, they got record profits in Lula and Dilma government, even at times of crisis. He did made the biggest indian reserve to date an actual reserve, but still his predecessor did made more reserves official, there is also the problem with land which he didn't touch it. In sumary you will see the left criticizing what Lula didn't do at that time.

some positions that are socially conservative (not uncommon in the LatAm left)
potential corruption (the oderbrecht scandal is the big elephant in the room but, as far as I know, no guilt was proven but also no not-guilty ruling was ever heard)
basically being more moderate than what the left wants (more of a biden than a bernie or any further left politician)

yibhth,https://www.reddit.com/user/Kapa51,24,"Lula is a liberal with good social programs, he goes with what I can only describe as ""the less shitty version of capitalism"". He's policies are focused on consumption power for the population and not a socialist agenda (save on very rare occasions), so he's more interested in lifting people from poverty under capitalism than to go against capitalism itself.
And that's the main issue with him, he proved to be capable of organizing the economy to give focus on the poorest groups and still keep the elites in profit, in a sense, less inequality under the same economic system, and so far so good, but, his biggest flaw was always to ignore the popular education and class consciousness, something he speaks about it often, but does the minimum possible, again, focusing on lifting the poorest to a more comfortable status while not going direct on the root cause. It works as far as he is in command, once he's out, people go right back to the shittiest situation.
One example, he got to put domestic service under the CLT, what are those? So, you know people who hire other people to take care of the house, normally in the north this is a very expensive thing, while in South America this is way more common because this profession is not regulated at all, and it's a fucking scar from slavery, I'm not kidding, there are apartments that have a separate room, usually on the kitchen, that serves to house people who work in the home. And this shit is not for very old apartments. So, the congress under Lula passed a law that inserted this profession under the CLT, the ""conciliation of the worker's law"", meaning that from this point forward this profession was under regulation, with vacations, social security, 13° salary, sick leave, minimum wage, etc. 
Well, the elite got pissed as fuck, and pissed with all kinds of things, like lower-class people going on airplanes, going to the mall, going to the parks, buying the same clothes, not accepting shitty jobs, etc.
And then, CORRUPTION, which is like saying the government is doing fine, nothing to see, every government is corrupt, and Lula's wasn't different, well, not quite, because even with the corruption, that was mainly in congress, the Workers Party put in practice the largest number of anti-corruption laws to practice, full congress transparency, more power to the Federal Police, new laws to impede condemned people to run for any office, etc. So, while the Workers Party was being investigated for corruption, it was also put forward the laws to do so, it's a large party, so it was bound to happen.
So, was Lula corrupt? Well, frankly, nobody knows, because when his successor, Dilma, took office and was reelected later, the congress started basically a legalized cue, there is even an audio recording of them preparing this. So, they took anything they could use against Dilma and impeached her. The funny thing is, they legalized the same crime they got her for a few years later
Another thing is the media, which was always right-wing, that also made a campaign to put on the Workers Party all the blame, I mean, full moral panic, emergency broadcasts for anything remotely related to Lula or Dilma.
And from all the historically corrupt parties in Brasil, the Workers Party was the scape goat, not that they were innocent, but it was like putting the scout in jail and set the bank robbers free.
My angle is, Lula knew that there was corruption and he kinda let it go under the rug to enable his projects, the elite didn't like his policies, and pressure on congress, they have their ""fall man"" or ""fall party"".
Okay, back to history, Dilma is gone, Lula is arrested by something, anything really, doesn't matter, he gets arrested in 2018, an election year, by a judge who was clearly communicating with the prosecutors, the evidence? Shit, anything goes, a paper he never signed, a local he never visited. Well, Lula was arrested, and guess who got a ministry just for him in  Bolsonaro's government, you guessed, the same fucking judge.
Well, the rest is, hehehe, history. Bolsonaro fucked up good, I mean, really good and the farse would never last, Lula got out, and Bolsonaro kept fucking up, Lula got back on full swing, and Bolsonaro? 10 dollars for the right answer, kept fucking up.
Corruption? Boy, even if you say that every crime of Lula is real, it pails against what Bolsonaro did because the worm legalized corruption, I'm dead serious, congress can basically send money wherever they want, how much they want, and we can't know even who sent it. I'm talking about a city receiving the money to remove the teeth of all its population, pastors receiving money from congress and bragging about it.
Now, Lula is president again, he will go on the same plataform, conciliation and public service, but now we don't want just that, we want the hole pie, and the first slice is to fuck up Bolsonaro good.

Remember the reaction on this subreddit to Pedro ""Big Pencil Man"" Castillo in Peru?  How he would be the great new left wing leader there and serve the poor and the workers and help them and all of the promises?  ""No more poors in Peru!""  Remember that? He's spent the last year brutalizing leftist protestors while pushing the same neoliberal austerity packages that the rest of South America is being forced to eat.
Lula is to the right of both Boric and Castillo, both in rhetoric and in policy/program.  The lesson needs to be learned by all of the socialists that this entire avenue has been a hopeless dead end, and that Pink Tide 2.0 is a failure (it didn't even reach the same levels of vague-anti-imperialism in rhetoric that Pink Tide 1 achieved), and almost all of the Pink Tide 2 leaders have become continuations of neoliberal austerity and extraction since taking office. Is the exact same neoliberalism better if it has a fake smiling socialist face rather than an overtly fascistic and hostile face?

If Boric is actually Tommy Carcetti, a good hearted person who deeply wants socialism but is so boxed in by the system that keeps forcing him to impose and implement and uphold neoliberalism that he is forced to keep doing so, how is that any different or more redeemable than if he's sincerely a sinister bourgeois traitor doing all the exact same things for essentially the same reasons (capitalism) but where he's less torn internally. 
If you are thinking that they all are sincerely left and just boxed into a corner, waiting for some imagined threshold to be crossed where there is a bunch of leftists ready to organize, then that point would explicitly and clearly be right now, since Brazil, the largest and most respectively powerful nation in South America is now ""left."" But this threshold was already reached and crossed under the first Pink Tide, and nothing came of it (as I mentioned, there was vague talk about an anti-imperialist bloc -- something totally absent from the Pink Tide 2.0 discussion) and six months from now when everyone here has forgotten who Lula even is and as he begins tearing down peasant's houses again for neoliberal resourcing operations everyone will just go on ignoring it like they are doing now with Boric and Castillo and a dozen others.
The problem is that enormous political energy, time, and effort are wasted on these leftist campaigns, which don't ever go anywhere or result in anything, and each time they continue the exact same neoliberal process that they came to power promising to oppose.  There is not going to be a solution that can emerge from within the confines of bourgeois electoralism for the Global South, and once that is recognized, then the time and energy and support can start going towards a real movement to change the present state of things, but it will be proletarian and revolutionary instead of bourgeois and electoralist.

yqk6kb,https://www.reddit.com/user/Blarghnog,6,"I just finished a write up on this very subject not a few hours ago (the positioning was merely that some of the policy wins are “taking us in the right direction”):
I know it’s not popular, but the truth is that the power elite in the United States typically have their hands in both parties (the true power, not the front of house funders), so much of the politics you see is similar to a rigged sports event. That’s why there is so little substantive change. The policies of both parties are substantially “do nothing” in terms of material progress. Climate change talks that exclude the meat industry for example. Banking oversight laws written by the bankers lobbyists themselves. Foreign policy sponsored by defense companies.
There are substantial differences in policies and platforms, but at the heart of both parties are massive piles of money. That’s why it costs 1.4B dollars to run for the presidential office in the USA.
When you point this out to people, they act like your attacking their home town team.
I think your right about how this is positioned, and I’m very glad to see some rational policies winning, but sometimes I wonder how much of it is smokescreen designed to keep people focused on controversy while substantive problems like reserve currency management, corporate profiteering and corruption, corrupt financial markets (GMA, GMA!), global energy and of course massive systemic inflation that threatens to destroy the lower and middle classes occupy so much less of the attention than they should. 
Why it impossible to consider that the two teams are cheating the public by playing towards their financiers instead of their responsibilities? Wouldn’t political corruption be the first point to consider, especially when unlimited spending on politicians is the foundation of the system and a fully legal and open and on display policy. Politicians need to be wearing jackets with their sponsors on them at this point. I have seen several large publishing systems that publish both a left and right news article out of the same newsroom. Makes you think.
I think that far more likely than the always-remarkably-well-times-issue-theater that is presented to the public for debate and voting. We get the distraction of the spectacle while the real power takes the rest.

And I hate to break it to you, but sure, ideally Rojava and its constituents deserve their own autonomous regions, and the current colonial borders are unfair. But their situation is not unique. The colonized peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Americas deal with the same problem.
But because Rojava leadership has chosen to take up arms and partnership with the US military, as well as them not uniting with their fellow colonized peoples around them, they have recently been doing more harm for their neighbors, as well as themselves. Unity amongst the colonized against the colonizers and imperialists should come before local ethnic struggles, and even discussions of economic organization. That's the only way to guarantee autonomy.

But then in the late 70s, Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge started crossing the border and started slaughtering villagers. This eventually forced Vietnam to invade Cambodia, where they exposed the infamous killing fields and labor camps (and then shut them down).

I'm not exactly there to discuss ""Russian Imperialism"" as by ML definition I don't see how Russia can be imperialist with such a useless economy. As a matter of fact even in that poorly worded ""Moskalis"" garbage how much of it is because of US policy and conditions they foster? Perhaps one could argue they are imperialists, I'd say the ambition is there, but the economic strength required just isn't. Russia is still exporting raw resources and isn't a financier of anything extracting wealth from every conceivable avenue. 
US imperialism is and should for US Americans be the biggest focus as internationalism and solidarity is hampered by US boots.

Obviously this did not happen for any particular noble reason like giving power to the people or something but out of a necessity to uphold the capitalist order of things.
But still, it's quite a shift in attitudes.

This is exactly what I dislike so much about parts of the American left. As someone explained it to me recently rather succinctly: 
""American right-wingers and left-wingers both believe in American exceptionalism: Right-wingers think America is exceptionally great and left-wingers that it's exceptionally shit."" 
The reality is that you're not that special, and focusing on America often does more to obfuscate than to illuminate. 
Obviously America has massive influence culturally, socially , economically and so on, but it's not some kind of almost religious ""first principle"" all things political (or in general) can be traced back to.
Of course you can make an argument about how the United States interfering into the 1996 Presidential election in Russia did backfire (including that it lead to reinvigorated Russian interference in American elections) or how shock therapy was a bad idea and bred resentment and whatever, but it will always remain only a partial explanation and never a sufficient one. 
When Putin e.g. invokes principles like ""Official Nationality"" as guiding vision for his country, it is not clear at all how the U.S. relates to this at all 19th century anti-Western doctrine at all. 
Well, frankly I disagree that imperialism is really the highest stage of capitalism and therefore your question doesn't really apply. I do think that Kautsky's idea of ""ultra-imperialism"" was not wrong really. 
Therefore, it does seem logical to me that a country kind of regressing in its developmental stage would revert to imperialism over ultra-imperialism.
Consider this: Russia today is becoming more and more (neo)feudalist by the hour. You can see it everywhere:
From the occupied Ukrainian regions reverting to the coat of arms of Tsarist times to Russia levying soldiers from ethnic minorities (like with the Cossacks of old) to his turn to autocracy. 
This feudalism correlates with expansionist and irredentist thinking, call it ""manifestation destiny"" or ""Отторженная возвратихь"" (that's the Russian version – contrary to popular belief, Russia didn't become the largest country in the world by inviting people to eat Borscht). 
It isn't imperialism in the sense Lenin thinks of it, but I dintdon't think this is actually relevant. 
Anyway, since I was little, I was convinced that the Marxist idea that the economic and social progress is linear in stages like my Mario games doesn't ring true and is kind of detached from reality. 
Why is it that the revolution succeeded in Russia, but not in Germany? Even Lenin himself never came up with a reasonable explanation for that consistent with Marxist theory. 
You can always try to argue about some vaguely insufficient material conditions or whatever, but considering the stage theory of development overall it just doesn't square.

I agree with this & orthodox Marxism just hadn't had time to yet see the world develop to really refine that theory. Clearly things aren't inevitable, imo, and there isn't any one theory that does more than broadly characterize unique places, you need analysis on the ground wherever it may be. 

: Russia today is becoming more and more (neo)feudalist by the hour

The organization of the economy is also starting resemble feudalism more as time goes in. Not in specifics, but in the way that capital is controlled & all that comes with that. I know capital itself can be seen as not being ""controlled"" in some instances by anyone, but I'm sure you understand what I mean.

However, the war has actually kind of fractured that liberal order, if even a tiny bit. If you were to tell most Marxists two years ago that the ""collective West"" would have seized Russian yachts, mansions and so on, they'd claimed you to be not sane.

I don't think many Marxists would've been that surprised by this statement two years ago, maybe ten. 

Well, first of all it is worth to remember that capital, not unlike the internationalist proletariat, doesn't have a country really. Not coincidentally do all of Russia's most nationalist, ""Russian world"" proponents send their children, assets and capital to the West.

You're right. Why do you mention this though?

This is exactly what I dislike so much about parts of the American left. As someone explained it to me recently rather succinctly: 
""American right-wingers and left-wingers both believe in American exceptionalism: Right-wingers think America is exceptionally great and left-wingers that it's exceptionally shit."" 

This is a fair criticism. The capitalist world order is ultimately propped up by conditions the US have created. That's not to say without the US it wouldn't have happened and revolution would've rages across the globe like wildfire. Someone else would've taken up that position because that's how capital behaves. 
As an American there is not much I can do from home except things that are focused on US. Maybe you find it to be a large gap in US leftists analysis when they're only critical of the US, but that doesn't mean there is no criticism of any other institutions elsewhere. 
American exceptionalism in its inverse is basically what you're saying that attitude is right? I don't see how anyone could be a leftist and not be critical of the US. Anarchism clearly has problems in tons of Marxist-Leninist analysis & principles, but offers no solutions. Clearly I think there is a bias in your analysis on Russo-Ukrainian war & Makhno flair shows that. The US is culpable there and deserves criticism, just like they do for the state of Russia presently. There really isn't much you'll see where the US isn't involved, but again if they weren't doesn't mean it would be rainbows. 
There are some hairs being split here that I just don't really think are worth splitting, especially when they don't lead to any useful conclusions or solutions. Opposing US imperialism & understanding solidarity means sacrifice as a person in the imperial core isn't being too hyperfocused, it is the right thing as someone on the imperial core without the ability to leave. 
Offer me an alternative that I can put into practice besides focusing on conditions in the one state I have any modicum of influence over no matter how small. Should those in Russia be opposing their state or is that too much focus on Russia when there are better things, that I've still got to be told about yet? On the topic of the bombing by the way US warships or planes not directly doing the destroying doesn't mean the US state isn't culpable or even nearly wholly responsible. Alternatives?

Well, at least we can comfort ourselves in the fact that liberals made the same mistake with ""the end of history"" and statements like that. It ain't over until it's over, and there's no end screen after completing a level. 

This is a fair criticism. The capitalist world order is ultimately propped up by conditions the US have created.

I'm not sure what you mean by that. I disagree that the ""capitalist world order"" emanates from the U.S., this interpretation does take away the agency of the rest of the world.
Ideas and ideologies are usually pluricentric in origin. The United States have been instrumental in creating, maintaining and propagating the current order of things, but they're neither the only ones nor is everyone just following the lead of the U.S.
It also goes the other way round. I've personally seen Chinese people supporting the CCP going on the strangest anti-Western (not antiimperialist!) rants and wondered whether I should ask them if they think that Karl Marx was a Han Chinese. But since the brother of Jesus Christ was Chinese, maybe Karl was as well.

As an American there is not much I can do from home except things that are focused on US. Maybe you find it to be a large gap in US leftists analysis when they're only critical of the US, but that doesn't mean there is no criticism of any other institutions elsewhere.

There's a famous German proverb steeped deep into but also predating the existence of the political right I'm deeply  at odds with: ""If everyone cares about themselves, everyone is being cared for."" 
I disagree with the notion that you ought only engage in IMBY topics or what one perceives as such. In fact, for most people outside of imperial powers such as the U.S., this would seem absurd already from a practicality standpoint. 
I think that it's rather interesting that leftists world wide engage in analysis of the U.S. – and U.S. leftists do too. So, what differentiates the latter from the former is not that either of those lack understanding about the U.S., but the rest of the world. 
Also, let me ask you this: What can you do in practical terms from America that is focused on the U.S.? It's not like the revolution is anywhere near the corner. 

American exceptionalism in its inverse is basically what you're saying that attitude is right? I don't see how anyone could be a leftist and not be critical of the US. 

I don't think that actually follows from rejecting the notion of America as exceptional – both bad or good.
On the contrary, by shrinking ""America"" down from its unrealistic perception as an almost conspiratorially enlarged fever dream to a place that is broadly similar to the rest of the world, we can enhance both our analysis of the U.S. and the rest of the world too. 
The idea is not so much that one shouldn't be critical of the U.S., but rather that the U.S. is not too dissimilar to the rest of the world.

The US is culpable there and deserves criticism, just like they do for the state of Russia presently.There really isn't much you'll see where the US isn't involved, but again if they weren't doesn't mean it would be rainbows. 

Is it though? See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. Is this U.S. you're describing in the room with us now? 
I stubbed my toe because of U.S. imperialism, I accidentally toasted my cat because of U.S. interventionism, I annexed my neighbour's garden shed and pillaged his gardening supplies because of NATO expansionism. To a hammer, everything are nails.
That Ronald Reagan supported the Afghan Mujaheedin will probably be a current discussion in leftist U.S. circles decades from now, that Russia currently is making trade deals with the Taliban mast months isn't even a discussion now .
I agree that the U.S. is involved almost everywhere (with often negative results), but that doesn't mean that everything that happens everywhere is either due to the U.S. or blowback to it. 
It's almost colonialist thinking really, because it clearly underestimates the agency of the rest of the world. Oh, how convenient is it to always cry ""CIA! CIA!"" and call it a day when anyone does anything anywhere. 

Opposing US imperialism & understanding solidarity means sacrifice [...]

Obviously I don't want you to renege on being solidary with victims of U.S. (or any other) imperialism. I'm merely cautioning against seeing everything from an American lense. Just because you're able to a kind of introspection American right-wingers obviously lack, doesn't mean it explains everything. 
Turning back to the Houthis for instance, I do obviously oppose Saudi-Arabia's bombing campaign and the U.S. involvement, but that doesn't mean I don't despise them as well. 
I had people genuinely get mad at me – as a German Jew, no less! – for not supporting a group whose motto is ""Curse upon the Jews!"", since apparently that's imperialist or something. 
This is the kind of logical short circuiting that can follow from always ""opposing US imperialism"" without giving further thkugh to it. 

Offer me an alternative that I can put into practice besides focusing on conditions in the one state I have any modicum of influence over no matter how small. 

Isn't the same true for your home as well? 
Imagine Lenin came to your home this very evening: ""Здравствуйте, Comrade, what is state of Social-Democratic Worker Party of Murica (Majority) or whatever you call it?"" 
What are you going to tell him? The REDdit ARMY is taking Washington (to be renamed Debsonia) any day now? 

Should those in Russia be opposing their state or is that too much focus on Russia when there are better things, that I've still got to be told about yet?

Well, Russians should definitively oppose their state. But then, this is true throughout Russian history. 
Now we mark almost two hundred years since the Decembrist revolt, and there is to hope, to quote a bit of Irish rebel music:
""you can wear an Easter Lily for the patriots of the past/Although they failed, the inspiration left by them would last""


On the topic of the bombing by the way US warships or planes not directly doing the destroying doesn't mean the US state isn't culpable or even nearly wholly responsible.

ypbtmw,https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator,1,"As a friendly reminder, China's ruling party is called Communist Party of China (CPC), not Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as western press and academia often frames it as.
Far from being a simple confusion, China's Communist Party takes its name out of the internationalist approach seekt by the Comintern back in the day. From Terms of Admission into Communist International, as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:

18 - In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party’s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official “Social-Democratic”, or “socialist”, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. 

Similarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.

You're right, it really is fascinating. The reason why public opinion can't always completely sway politics in a democracy is, because it's not an  Ochlocraty. Those never worked over long periods of time, democracy did for multiple, fascinating reasons.

, yet the War on Terror (invading countries for no reason) lasted 20 years. Like that full 5 American presidents

The actual reasons are quite complex (basically regional stability, resources but it really is much more complex).
Every single country in the image had a more or less large group of supporters, who welcomed US troops. When they left, things got really fucked.
In countries where US supporters didn't suceed, it's not going well either.

Secondly, it is a result of your ignorance if you believe that imperialism begins and ends with territorial expansion.

The US regularly props up despots who in turn allow the US to plunder their country, and violently repress left-wing movements which seek to change that arrangement. Russia does so, although not nearly on the same scale as the US due to the fact that Russia is far weaker.

Vietnam became a colony of soviet social-imperialism, which became very obvious once they invaded Kampuchea. They too have a privatized economy and are living under semi-feudal conditions.
DPRK hade the same faith as Vietnam falling under control of Soviet imperialism. They have redacted all mentions of marxism and communism.
Cuba never even tried to have a socialist revolution, Fidel Castro led a bourgeois democratic revolution, he explicitly stated that he is not a marxist or a communst and that he was completely against the dictatorship of the proletariat; 
""I am not a communist and neither is the revolutionary movement, but we do not have to say that we are anticommunists just to fawn on foreign powers."" - Fidel Castro, 17 July 1959
""I am not a communist for three reasons, and I tell you this for your spiritual peace of mind. First, because communism is the dictatorship of a single class and I have fought all my life against dictatorships and I am not going to fall into a dictatorship of the proletariat. The second reason, because communism means hatred and class struggles and I am completely against that philosophy. And the third because communism fights against God and the Church"" - Fidel Castro; In interview with journalist Ignacio Rasco, April 1959
They then started calling themselves socialist when they ultimately sided with soviet social-imperialism as well. They became a very strategic position for Societ military interests, with them placing nuclear arsenal by their shorelines.
The Bolivian, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan governments suppress revolutionairy uprisings with the use of military interventions and police.

y7bmt1,https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator,1,"As a friendly reminder, China's ruling party is called Communist Party of China (CPC), not Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as western press and academia often frames it as.
Far from being a simple confusion, China's Communist Party takes its name out of the internationalist approach seekt by the Comintern back in the day. From Terms of Admission into Communist International, as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:

18 - In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party’s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official “Social-Democratic”, or “socialist”, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. 

Similarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.

Perhaps the protests were initially organic. However, that is certainly not the case now. Did you notice how these protests only happened after Iran sold Russia its Shahed-136 drones? Such loitering munitions are incredibly effective, and this is in part why the west is absolutely intent on stopping them and why they've also sent anti-air systems to Ukraine.

A socialist, or at least anti imperialist revolution in Iran deserves support, but blindly supporting any color revolution using rallying cries you nominally agree is the exact CIA play book to justify American intervention and regime change. 
I haven't done enough research into the situation in Iran to have an opinion on it, and you may be right to support this revolution, I'm just saying that a blank check of support to all revolutions isn't a wise long term strategy for bringing about global socialism. What might bring about minor liberal changes in one region could strengthen the Imperialist hegemony globally and actually wind up setting back socialist development instead of advancing it.

The situation in Iran has revealed that so many people who claim to be leftists are really brainbroken supporters of ""anything that is against the US"". 
There is also a lot of not so subtle orientalism/ infantilization of the global south/ non western countries in which people seem to think that Iranians are not capable of coming up with the unique idea of being against a regime that has raped, murdered, imposed barbaric religious fundamentalism, suppressed and repressed women, robbed the country of its wealth and sent their children to the west to live lives of luxury with blood money, list goes on. Oh no, its gotta be a CIA color revolution.... Are people really that brainbroken that they think people don't have agency and minds of their own? This isn't Cuba where the government is actually trying to do the best by its people but American sanctions and embargo suffocate them.  As leftists you should know that the ""islamic revolution"", was a counter-revolution, the revolution against the Shah was begun by socialists, university students, and unionists, but the mullahs took the revolution over by lying to the people, and being pushed and propped up by western countries to make sure Iran didn't go socialist. Now for so called leftists to be skeptical of the Iranian people or to not want Iran to become free of these islamic gangsters because they feel Iran has to be part of the anti global neoliberalism group or whatever other nonsense, you are not my comrades. If you support a (theocratic) fascist regime for any mental gymnastics reasoning, you are not my comrades. 
The people who think this is a CIA color revolution have clearly never spoken to an Iranian, none the less anyone actually in Iran. Nobody is happy with this government, this is not a revolution because of hijab, its a revolution because of EVERYTHING. Everything sucks and everyone is fed up. Even religious people who wear the hijab are against the government hand in hand with the girls who have burned their hijabs. People want freedom, they want personal liberties, they want an economy, they want jobs, they want a government that doesn't steal the wealth of the nation. These Islamic goons are basically the same as the Russian Oligarchs, except they have the flavor of religion on top of them.  
We Iranians have suffered Alexander the not so great, Arabs, Mongols, Turks, England, USA, Russia, we will cast out the Mullahs too. We have resisted Arabization and Islamization attempting to eradicate our culture, language, and history for 1400 years, we will survive this too.

Image Transcription: Debs ran for President five times, captivating crowds by the tens of thousands. [newyorker.com]
Eugene V. Debs, born on this day in 1855, was an American socialist, trade unionist, founding member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and five time presidential candidate of the Socialist Party of America.
Through his presidential candidacies and labor organizing, Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States.
While in prison for leading the Pullman Strike, Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent to the international socialist movement.
Debs was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America (1897), the Social Democratic Party of America (1898) and the Socialist Party of America (1901). Debs ran as a Socialist candidate for President of the United States five times, including 1900 (earning 0.6% of the popular vote), 1904 (3.0%), 1908 (2.8%), 1912 (6.0%) and 1920 (3.4%), the last time from a prison cell. He was also a candidate for United States Congress from his native state Indiana in 1916.
Debs was noted for his fiery oration. In 1918, Debs was arrested after giving a speech denouncing American participation in World War I. He was convicted under the Sedition Act of 1918 and sentenced to a term of 10 years. In his speech to the court, Debs provided one of his most well-known quotes:
""Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.""

yn9nl2,https://www.reddit.com/user/A_Peoples_Calendar,71,"Debs has many quotes to draw inspiration from. He had a profound understanding of both capital and revolutionary politics:

The issue is Socialism versus Capitalism. I am for Socialism because I am for humanity. We have been cursed with the reign of gold long enough. Money constitutes no proper basis of civilization. The time has come to regenerate society — we are on the eve of universal change.


Open letter to the American Railway Union, Chicago Railway Times (1 January 1897)


The class which has the power to rob upon a large scale has also the power to control the government and legalize their robbery.

* .
The labor platforms of the Republican and Democratic parties are interchangeable and non-redeemable. They both favor “justice to capital and justice to labor.” This hoary old platitude is worse than meaningless. It is false and misleading and so intended. Justice to labor means that labor shall have what it produces. This leaves nothing for capital. Justice to labor means the end of capital.
* .
I have no country to fight for; my country is the earth; I am a citizen of the world.
* .
I am opposing a social order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing that is useful to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars, while millions of men and women who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough for a wretched existence.
* .
Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind then that I was not one bit better than the meanest on Earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it; and while there is a criminal element, I am of it; and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.

yn9nl2,https://www.reddit.com/user/chayleaf,12,"I do not dream of Stalin days, when fascist Germany was murdering millions of Soviet citizens. Nobody would want to live during such a brutal war, no matter the government. Your tale about Yeltsin might be fun for idealists (if we ignore how Yeltsin led an anti-constitutional military coup, or how Yeltsin's policies resulted in poverty and child prostitution), but it doesn't explain anything about capitalism, communism or socialism. Your closest attempt to defining socialism was ""state owns everything including the land under your feet"". This definition might get us closer to understanding socialism than the Yeltsin thing, but first, we have to ask the question - what is the state? Whose interests does it act in? We see that in American multiparty system, the state, no matter the party, acts in the interests of capitalists. We see the same in countries like FrenchFrance, with a ""free market""-oriented Macron and a ""protect local companies""-oriented Le Pen, who simply represent the interests of different capitalists. Hitler rose to power through support of the industrialists, and Mussolini was massively funded by British intelligence agencies among others. Russia has multiple parties, the difference between which accounts for nothing when you look at their actual actions in state institutions, and in practice they all simply enact the rule of the ruling class.
However, socialists seek a different goal altogether. They seek to take power from capitalists and give it to the working class. A system that inherently protects the interests of capitalists wouldn't work for this purpose. That's why socialists' goal is to establish a socialist revolution, overthrowing the old bourgeois government. It should be replaced with a bottom-up democratic government that has nothing in common with the bourgeois representative democracy. The USSR had such a system - Soviet democracy.
State ownership's character depends on the state's character. A bourgeois state has to maintain the system of private property, of exploitation and wage slavery. A workers' state is free from the shackles of capital, it can achieve long term goals not rooted in profit (such as fighting climate change or going to space), it can reduce the working day and improve living conditions thanks to increases in productivity. In contrast, in America, productivity has been on the rise, yet wages have been stagnating for like 50 years already.
Furthermore, socialism, by abolishing the need for the bourgeoisie, sets us on the road to a classless, moneyless, stateless society. Such a society is called communist.

yh6eyh,https://www.reddit.com/user/Typical_Hussar,4,"The French are protesting for the working class. The rich are not affected by this- it is us worker who must fight for our rights, like the French protesters. They might not all be socialists, but they are fighting for positive change that improves the lives of workers. That is why we call them comrades: although not every protester is socialist, every protester stands for the working class and worker’s rights. 
The collapse of Russia was entirely the fault of those in power. They stifled change, and stifled progress. The Russian revolution could have been an amazing thing, and in many places it was- the bolsheviks were not the only faction fighting the whites, there were many other communist and socialist currents: farmer’s movements erupted even within Bolshevik territory, and the black army of Ukraine fought Germans, Austrians, whites, reds, and other Ukrainian factions alike. The Bolsheviks did not win because every socialist stood with them-the Bolsheviks won because Lenin and his goons suppressed, backstabbed, and murdered alternative socialist movements until the bolsheviks were the only ones left. 
Lenin was a communist. But the state he created was not. It was hardly socialist, and a more accurate term for it would be “state capitalism”. The reason for this is because businesses were not taken over by the workers, which is the goal of socialism, they were taken over by the Bolshevik party and the government of the ussr. Instead of having a private boss, factories now had a state- backed boss- while the whole point of socialism is to get rid of the boss’s coercive power. 
Mussolini started out as socialist, but got pissed because socialists weren’t fascist enough, so he invented his own current. He believed in state control over workplaces- while he himself would claim to be a socialist, he did nothing to help the working class. And don’t forget that it was the communist partisans who killed Mussolini- I think that the fact that Mussolini was killed by socialists sort-of evens out that whole situation. Most partisan movements against Italian fascism had a large aspect of socialists and communists within them: Italy was a center of a large amount of diverse leftist thought. If Mussolini could really be considered a socialist, how come it would be the socialists that killed him? How come it was socialists that made up most of the groups of partisans that fought him throughout his whole dictatorship? 
Eugenics are not an economic problem, socialism is an economic theory. Eugenics were not made to benefit socialists or the cause of socialism, they were made for completely different purposes not related to the economy. Thus they cannot be claimed as socialist. 
Your statement is flawed.

Being satisfied with the way something looks long term isn't profitable because it doesn't demand updating or replacing. Popular opinion of what is ""ugly"" is largely associated with what people perceive as dated. As evidenced (at least in my region) by time periods where we dismantled many stone buildings to replace with wood. Not just to appear modern and sophisticated at the time but also to drive the lumber industry.
Brutalism was far more, if not entirely, function-focused which no longer (currently) announces the extravagance, modernity, or progressiveness so many people naively associate with wasted space.

So-called ""Stalin baroque""
Architecture design, especially concerning notable buildings, is very competitive. Lots of projects are presented and the best one is chosen.
Sharing of ideas and specialists. I can assume that whole soviet block was sharing ideas and specialists. Having a good architecture bureau in, say, St.Petersburg, they could participate in desing in, say, Bulgaria.
I can assume that higher education in architecture design was state financed on high level. And students and young specialists had a place to work after graduation. Check out the design of soviet bus stops , that were, as I can assume, somewhat of a training for young architects

But we must find some other way to democratize it and amplify those that excel, even if that thought may be at odds with the thought of equality. The opportunity to create may be equal, but results must matter.
Europeans remember what it was like in the Cold War years when every little thing was manual and droves of workers had to be housed in societal ideologies that were drifting away from the ideal. Signal buildings are of little importance in comparison to the much more common grey rectangles. You'll have a heck of a time trying to convince them that these were pillars of pride and inspiration in those already falling societies. They might also give the wrong idea. Authoritarians built grander things on a whim, as was their prerogative. Were we to strive for such things?
Also, is it an american thing to see Soviet as a success, as something to be associated with?

yex8eh,https://www.reddit.com/user/medivhthewizard,3,"Alright. From my perspective, the fact that Islamic Republic is not doing Imperialism by this definition is mostly due to their incapability to do so, and my reasons are as follows:

During the Syrian civil war, and Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, they haveconstantly emphasized on the importance of controlling these contries' markets, and their resources. However, their Russian and Chinese overlords shoved them out of the line. They tried to have puppet governments in Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan, in Addition to Assad in Syria to guarantee their interests.
They are treating certain regions inside their territory as mere colonies. Sistaan and Baloochistan is one such province, which despite being part of the Iranian soil for thousands of years, and having one of the most important trading ports of Iran, Chaabahaar, is treated as foreign. They are alienated and labeled as uncivilized brutes and armed terrorists by the state media. They are kept in abject poverty without access to clean water and electricity in many regions. Khuzistan province is also ravaged by infrastructural problems, despite being the source of the majority of Iran's wealth (oil).

Additionally, the moral corruption of politicians and military commanders is not well-reflected in the international news and a foreigner can never realize it as well as someone who lives inside Iran. All of these makes it very hard for me to believe they have superior intentions compared to US or other Imperialist forces.

yex8eh,https://www.reddit.com/user/kemala_harris,13,"radical political organization in iran was marginalized and eventually shattered in the aftermath of the 1979 revolution. however, from what i've seen of these displays of resistance so far, it's many of the same demographics mobilizing this time around as well — women, militant elements in the labor force, ethnic minorities and students/academics. like during the shah's time, political organization is likely present and driving these actions from the underground; we don't hear about it because it's overwhelmingly clandestine and very dangerous if word of that kind of organizing gets out.
if i were to guess, their mode of organization is something akin to the shora system developed during the revolution, though conditions for such a political model to arise are obviously very different these days. the localized successes of refinery strikes in particular mirror the revolutionary history of the country, but it's notable that they're striking on the demand of regime change — this is a radical goal in a theocracy with a powerful entrenched clergy, and very different from the past strategy of striking over smaller-scale economic aims and building into radical demands. we'll see how it plays out.
so basically we don't really know from a western vantage point, but given the wide array sectors involved in agitation (particularly labor), there's likely a good bit of coordination between them. there are important echoes of the country's revolutionary history at play, but the alignments of key polities and demographics have changed drastically and make it harder to draw conclusions from that. but this is a crucial development and an inflection point for a government that's facing unprecedented, profound defiance

According to slate, and every other source I've seen, lawyers looked in to a patent but they did so after Salk and his organization decided to forgo a patent. Apparently no one knows why, but the intention was always to avoid a patent due to the thought that public had already paid for the vaccine through public funding. I've never seen anything claiming Salk wanted to patent the drug but was told he couldn't. To add to this, the ĺawyers who said it couldn't be patented were wrong because we have hundreds of drugs of this type on patent now, so they definitely could have patented the vaccine if they wanted to. They just would have had to push.

It is atrocious to think that there are people that support making strikers pay the companies for costs a company incurred during a strike.
This specific case is about 16 out of 45 cement truck drivers who went on strike that returned trucks to the yard full of cement with which managers had to empty making them miss a planned delivery.
The right to leave your job, at any time you feel necessary, should always be protected. If we cannot decide to stop working for another human when we feel the need to, what have we become?
For another real world example of how this will look, a striking union in Alabama is currently being sued by the company they're striking for $13,000,000 of which the charges are made up of:

increased security
increased labor
barriers
security cameras
capital expenditures
buses for transporting scabs across picket lines
the cost of lost production

I hear preaching every day about how easy it would be to replace workers and that you shouldn't organize because you'll just be replaced, all of this activity proves that is a simple lie.
I leave you with the wise words of the UMWA President Cecil Roberts, ""What is the purpose of a strike if not to impact the operations of the employer, including production. Is it now the policy of the federal government that unions be required to pay a company’s losses as a consequence of their members exercising their rights as working people? This is outrageous and effectively negates workers’ right to strike. It cannot stand.""

I agree, hence protesting when you show up to work and not after starting work. Now had something prompted them to protest via a change in policy, right in the middle of a work day...by all means, start the protest then. Honestly, if you are going to comment on a multi day old news comment, unless read it correctly. I never said to do in your spare time. I said ""start"" the protest before or after work. Therefore, their is no destruction in property, employer is still hurt by lack of future workforce, their is no potential for safety or damage due to you not doing your job as it was never started.

The way concrete trucks are compared to human lives here is illuminating. This was peaceful protesting. Pointing at the damage to property as a form of violence, helpfully highlights the protest is a response to violence.

YouConcrete maytrucks are not compared to human lives but good reading. I am describing how if you use the logic in this situation, you set society up for poor consequences. I think you can imagine this and put yourself in other shoes for a moment. I'm describing a ""slippery slope"" scenario vs. you stating a direct comparison. If you set protest laws and standards off one job/task, my question is simply what about people who have mejobs herethat involve life safety? Would you accept a group of air traffic controllers, protesting right in the middle of their shift? Or would you find it common decency for them to protest before their shift starts such that planes would never take off for that airport as a destination or have time to be re-routed. If you say concrete drivers can protest in the middle of shifts, why is it fair by law for other jobs to not? What is with the discrimination there? Human lives are much more important than property, but you have already set the standard of saying it is ok to protest mid shift regardless of consequences. I am saying standardize when it is ok. And that would be before or after shift unless your employer is asking you to endanger you life, another life, something that is against you beliefs, etc.
I simply don't know the whole story. I guess it depends on ""what"" they were protesting. If their lives were in danger, hell yeah, stop work then and there. If they were simply protesting more pay, no, that does not give you the right to damage property.
Right and wrong are funny things. I don't have the answer because I don't know or understand the full story. But I can tell you I would never purposefully damage property that wasn't mine in protest unless it was for something much higher in meaning thatthan more pay.
Also, I never compared concrete trucks to human lives. They were violent, yet I am not aware as to whether the employers were being violent to the workers. It wasn't really stated or described by OP unless they have edited their original comment.

i.e. off the clock.
A lack of future workforce is by no means guaranteed. I do not believe that worker rights can and should only be fought for in areas where there are a lack of workers.
There seems an arbitrary line where 'damages' are concerned. Property damage might include a batch of cookies aren't sold the same morning they are baked, or an IT service not releasing a promised update. Are there protests which don't cause some sort of property damage and some which cross a line of 'common decency'? Consider who is drawing that line in this case.

Also, I never compared concrete trucks to human lives.

Claiming that if we accept people damaging trucks in protest, we might be accepting people doing this to human lives draws a line of comparison between the two. There is a meaningful difference which can (and has) been accounted for. From any aspect of any story can be drawn arbitrary extreme conclusions. Focusing back down on the story can help.

They were violent, yet I am not aware as to whether the employers were being violent to the workers.

If you would never damage property for something as trivial as pay. Try believing the people in the story wouldn't either. All us humans are fairly similar.

Yes, fascism is the perverse logical extension of liberalism (“capitalism in decay”), but liberals also exist who aren’t fully fascist, and as a leftist you’re in a better position to push back against polite partial fascists than full-on in-your-face open fascists.
Fascist states almost never get ousted by socialist revolutions unless the fascist party was installed by an outside entity (e.g. recently in Bolivia), because fascism pretty much exists to prevent a socialist revolution from happening when conditions have been reached that would otherwise make it inevitable. So as a leftist, you want Republicans in power even less than you want Democrats.
Of course, voting doesn’t do much, it just seems silly to discourage leftists from doing it, as long as they don’t think it actually solves anything (as opposed to just helping buy a bit of time).

One recent example which might help illustrate it is the United States 2020 presidential election between two rabid anti-socialists; Joe Biden and Donald J. Trump (or any other US electoral process).
If you feel strongly in favor of opting for lesser evilist methods and cannot refrain from commenting on it, please share it outside of r/Socialism. This is a space for conscious anti-capitalist analysis only.

The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 is a foundational statute of United States labor law that guarantees the right of private sector employees to organize into trade unions, engage in collective bargaining, and take collective action such as strikes. Central to the act was a ban on company unions. The act was written by Senator Robert F. Wagner, passed by the 74th United States Congress, and signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. -wikipedia

Why in the hell would any political party want an informed electorate and vote against their own best interests when the system is set up to allow legal bribery through campaign donations from oligarchs, insider trading so they can enrich themselves, the best Healthcare and insurance possible and one heel if a retirement package all provided with our tax dollars. There are a few in Congress not playing that game and actually have our interest in mind, but not enough. Thing is, those of us who are informed have to not get apathetic and try to inform everyone we can.

But I do want to point out one thing: corporate profits could be justified on the basis of record high corporate debt.  This is particularly true of Oil and Gas, many producers in the States were nearly or already bankrupt when oil hit -$20 a barrel (for just a few minutes).  Producers in North America and the UK have a breakeven production price around $50 a barrel.  Prices lower than that were subsidized with debt, and although it's only an approximate analogy, today's oil prices are ""making up"" for many years of sub-$50 prices over the last 15 years.

It may cost you more in farmhand wages to harvest the tomatoes than you would make selling them.

You're right in that it represents the interests of the ruling class, but they don't oppress these intersections of the working class just because they feel like it, or create some arbitrary ideological dogma. They create these divisions of oppressions because this represents the working class of the country, and these oppressions have been necessary for the ruling class to maintain their dictatorship over us, and these oppressions have been handy tools in maintaining that. If they found different, random lines of oppressions then they would use those too (and arguably they do).

And the important thing is that it uses an anti-imperialist and anti-colonial lense to make its conclusions, making it better than all the ideologies which are bourgeois and claim the capitalist nations as the morally superior ones, and all the socialist nations the inferior ones.

$13 trillion is equivalent to around $108,000 per person in the 18 to 65 employable range.

EDIT:
So I looked into it and Sachs never said that.
The claim that he did is cited by the Wikipedia article about him. 
Wikipedia links to an article by The Independent - who write the following sentence:

In August, Mr Sachs came under fire after he compared vaccine mandates to the Holocaust on a podcast hosted by anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy Jr, the son of the former attorney general and New York Senator of the same name.
Mr Kennedy Jr appeared on the podcast not long after Meta banned some of the accounts he managed from Facebook and Instagram after they spread misinformation about Covid-19, The Daily Beast noted.

The Independent in-turn cites The Daily Beast, who write:

The following month, Sachs appeared on a podcast hosted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has become one of the internet’s leading anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists and caused outrage by comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust. Sachs’ appearance on Kennedy’s show came just days after Meta banned accounts led by Kennedy from Facebook and Instagram for spreading COVID misinformation.

In other words, The Independent either misunderstood The Daily Beast and didn't do any fact-checking (i.e., listening to the podcast episode in-question to verify the comments) OR it made a pretty egregious typo and carelessly haven't corrected it still.
RFK Jr. is the one who made those comments, not Sachs.

Let me give you a run-down of growing up as an American.


Depending on your school, you're going to learn and recite the Pledge of Allegience to the flag every day starting either Kindergarten or First Grade. As a child, you can refuse and they can't legally do anything about it -- no one will tell you this.
History classes through your entire schooling will focus almost entirely on WW2 (and even then primarily on the US's involvement in it), the Civil War, and the Revolutionary War. WW1 gets the next most coverage. Korea and Vietnam may be covered, but will mostly be glossed over. Some schools skip the War of 1812 entirely; I didn't learn about it until I was already an adult.
I am not joking. You will receive a history education focusing primarily on US involvement in WW2 every single year.
Starting around Junior High (grades 6-8), the military will begin sending recruiters to give speeches to the kids. Through high school (grades 9-12), the recruiters' visits are increased. If possible, the recruiter will be someone from the area so the kids already know them. I grew up in a rural area and the recruiters were always someone we already knew. Talks, push-up competitions, free pens (for some reason), and the ever-present reminder that ""YOU, YES YOU, CAN AFFORD A COLLEGE EDUCATION WITH THE MILITARY.""
The Defense Department offers aid to companies seeking realistic information about military matters in exchange for the right to censor the content. As a result, media will often do things like attribute US violations of the Geneva Conventions to other countries instead. You watch movies? You play video games? You will not get a true depiction of reality in them.

The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice (Division) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), assisted by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi (USAO), have completed their investigation into the June 21, 1964 murders of Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, three volunteers in the civil rights movement working in Neshoba and Lauderdale Counties, Mississippi.  The investigation and this report are authorized by the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, 28 United States Code § 509 (Pub.L.110-344, 122 Stat. 3934) (Emmett Till Act).  This Emmett Till Act investigation focused on (1) whether sufficient admissible evidence currently exists to support further state prosecution against any surviving person for involvement in the murders; and (2) whether certain witnesses made recent federally prosecutable false statements to FBI agents.  We closely coordinated with Jim Hood, the Attorney General for the State of Mississippi, because of his prosecutive authority in this case.[1]
After considering all credible leads and exhausting all viable investigative tools, we have determined that no further federal investigation is warranted at this time.  Additionally, we have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support a prosecutable federal violation of any person under Title 18 United States Code § 1001, for willfully making material false statements to federal investigators.  In this report, we also convey our investigative findings to the Mississippi Attorney General for his consideration of whether there is sufficient evidence to support state criminal charges.
At the outset, it should be acknowledged that nine individuals have been successfully prosecuted for these heinous crimes.  In the 1967 case of United States v. Price (Price), the Department’s Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights John Doar and his team of federal prosecutors convicted eight defendants – James Edward Jordan, Cecil Ray Price, Alton Wayne Roberts, Horace Doyle “H.D.” Barnette, Billy Wayne Posey, Jimmy Arledge, Jimmy Snowden, and Sam Holloway Bowers[2] – for violating the federal criminal civil rights conspiracy statute.[3]  In 2005, Mississippi Attorney General Hood and Neshoba County District Attorney Mark Duncan convicted Edgar Ray Killen of state manslaughter charges in Mississippi v. Killen (Killen).

""Knights perform dangerous stunts that require them to fight with real titanium weapons and throw themselves off horses at 25 mph for the performance, Zapcic said.
These dangerous duties have led to ankle, knee, and head injuries, according to performers in New Jersey, and knights do them all for about $19 to $29 an hour.
""The job will always be dangerous for the guys, but they should be compensated accordingly,"" she said. ""There should be a correlation between how dangerous their job is and how they're compensated.""
Those who want to become knights and aspire to go into athletics or become a stunt performer typically start off as squires, who make ""essentially minimum wage,"" Zapcic told the LA Times. A knight who previously worked as a squire at the New Jersey castle made $12 an hour.
The horses and falcon that the show rely on also add an element of uncertainty for workers' safety, particularly for stablehands who can make $16 an hour.
Zapcic compared Medieval Times shows to Broadway shows, seating about the same number of people and putting on more shows a week. They put up to 10 to 16 shows during a normal week compared to most Broadway shows' eight, but the number can go up to 21 between Christmas and New Year's Day. Many knights and squires will have to perform in nearly every show during this busy season.""

Without a union, workers have nothing to protect their jobs, improve workplace environment, increase wages, improve health insurance coverage, and have better job security and stability. Companies have been trying to destroy unions for decades. I think that Covid-19 demonstrated the importance of unions. Many people lost their six-figure jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although, while I do not make anywhere near six figures yet, I am happy that I have never lost my public sector job during the pandemic.

""As a South Asian American socialist, I really think that celebrating Sunak for his South Asian ethnicity is akin to praising Margaret Thatcher for having been a woman Prime Minister.
Just like Thatcher was, Sunak is a ruthless representative of the billionaire class, not of working women, people of color, or immigrants.
With a net worth over £730 million, Sunak is extremely wealthy. His wife, Akshata Murty, is the daughter of an Indian billionaire. Sunak was revealed, only a few months ago, to have used his wife’s non-domicile tax status to avoid up to £20 million in taxes.
The Tories are in deep crisis. And their whole agenda is to try and inflict all the misery of the recession on working people.""

So a few friends and I hijacked the event by putting up our own posters promoting attendance. We framed it as a ""CLASS A CRITICAL THINKING ALERT."" So all the sensible people showed up.
At the event (which was well attended), my friends and I had prepared posterboard signs with the names of all the common logical fallacies. ""STRAW MAN"", ""APPEAL TO AUTHORITY"", ""AD HOMINEM"" and one more that just read ""NOT REALLY"". So when the debate came, we sat in the front row and stood up with the appropriate sign as the foolish person committed those fallacies.
The Christian group actually did call the campus police on us for ruining their event. But guess what? We weren't actually doing anything illegal. We didn't disrupt the event. We were just responding to what we were seeing just like supporters would. It's free speech. If some foolish person wanted to bring signs to say how logical and great the foolish person's performance was, that would certainly be fair game. The police didn't even talk to us. There was nothing to say.
We were able to get a lot of people to sign up for the Skeptics Club that night. As we had someone with an ironing board and a clipboard at the entrance.

Edit: better yet, circulate a petition to get them moved to a venue that isn’t disruptive to student life, and to not have student activity fees spent on them.

As I say, my student activism days are well behind me (think Iraq war, LGBT+ civil rights) and in very different circumstances, so awareness/engagement/visibility were more important. Equally, anti-fascist stuff was much more about turning out bodies: opposing marches and drawing external attention to underground activities.

So internal activism again was about putting forward enough signatures on a petition to back up the student's union or the lecturers.

The reason for this is: the right wing has adapted to the current environment. Charlie Kirk and the other young right wing thought leaders have grown out of internet trolling culture. The only way they know to get attention is by getting a reaction, and through ""debate"", i.e. shouting down their opponent, trying to get them angry and getting viewers to see how frustrated their opponents get and how ""calm and civil"" they are. The actual messaging is from whoever pays their bills and is irrelevant to the tactics. 
I'm not saying that public protests are bad in general at all. All I'm saying is that we can't apply the same strategy we used to protest the Iraq war and police brutality against real life internet trolls. That's literally what they expect and what they are trying to take advantage of. Instead we need a strategy that doesn't give them any video or sound clips to repeat on their talk shows and to end up in the newspapers.

The fact is, they WANT the protests.  They WANT people who hate them to get tickets and disrupt the meeting. They thrive on controversy and reactions from the left. 
So here’s what you should do: if your university is like mine, tickets to the event are free, but only one per person. Be very discreet about this.  Don’t let anyone know about this plan who might spill the beans to his supporters. Get everyone you know who hates Charlie Kirk and the TPUSA to reserve a seat. As many as you possibly can. Then, and this is the key; DON’T show up. Let those seats remain empty. Nothing hurts him as bad as a mostly empty auditorium. It’s much worse for them than a bunch of disruptions.

Stay with the friendly crowd.  Don’t get drawn into the open or into a hostile crowd.
in keeping with the above, don’t get baited or go looking for a fight.  Great way to catch a beating or make yourself a target for arrest.
Watch your ass while leaving the event and don’t get followed back to your car, especially if you’re parked in a garage.
If you’re expecting serious trouble, let a trusted person know where you’re going and have a stash of money set aside so they can bail you out.
Don’t conceal your identity or bring a weapon unless you are 100% read up on the legalities and comfortable with the degree of doing sorisk.

Honestly though, I have doubts about the utility of these protests in the first place.  Regardless of what happens, the Conservativeconservative celebrity can usually just spin it into more content (and more money).  The only way to really de-platform one of these people is to physically stop/intimidate them, drown out the event, make security for the event cost-prohibitive, etc.  Generally that requires overwhelming numbers or people who are willing to engage in risky/illegal tactics.  YouI seemget tothe impression that you think that Charlie Kirk isn’t worth going to jail over and I 100%tend to agree personally.
If you just want something to do, or to link up with other leftists in your area, it can serve that purpose I guess.  I met a lot of cool people through protests.  Keep your temper in check, don’t do anything silly and you’ll almost always be fine.

The Muslim brotherhood has been decimated over the last decade and have lost a great deal of popularity. The freeing of political dissidents and police brutality are seen as issues as well. COP27 only matters in that protesters believe the government might be less heavy handed with all eyes on Egypt at the very least it will be an embarrassment for them.

Amnesty International article, published 5 days ago.
Alaa Abdelfattah is a leftist critic of the military dictatorship in Egypt and the Islamist reactionaries alike. He has been a political prisoner for the past 9 years. He is often tortured, humiliated and touted by prison guards.  His fellow political prisoners and cell mates are denied access to to even food and water. You'd expect the bastard cops to use these tactics to turn people against leftists. Alaa is now on a food and water strike. 
The protesters will demand freeing all prisoners. The state regime wouldn't mind killing them all. In fact, they massacred more than a thousand protesters in August 2013 alone. But with all eyes to Egypt for COP27, the military dictator knows that any human right abuse might turn to a horrible blow for his PR campaign. This is why EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EGYPT!
It's ironic that they chose the country with the worst human rights record to host a climate change summit.
The military regime has, for nearly a decade, privatized industry, transportation, education, healthcare. It has sucked the life out of the working class of Egypt. If El-Sisi could chop up poor Egyptian to feed his fancy rich friends and tourists, he would have done so.

When we condition for wealth, the legislation that gets passed by the Congress correlates with the policies the upper 10% of wealth holders support by 90%. Even if Americans are unified, it is still a struggle to pass any popular policies. Now mix in wedge issues, conservatives leading the proletariat astray, and the increasing polarization between the urban and the rural, barely anything popular gets passed at all.
Ultimately, the unsustainability of capitalism means that politicians (who seek to preserve capitalism) are in a constant balancing act where they do not want the proletariat to become educated and realize their exploitation, which builds solidarity; but the politicians also do not want to risk the proletariat becoming totoo poor, which would cause an overthrow of the government altogether and would result in either socialism or fascism, depending on who is leading the revolution (or reaction). There are also the fascists within the gates as well, specifically T***p and his allies. 
TL;DR the end result is that we, the majority of average working Americans have little say in domestic policy much less foreign policy. Though most do not realize this fact.

On 5 July 2021, he was selected as the next prime minister of Haiti by President Jovenel Moïse, but two days later, Moïse was assassinated, stalling the transfer of power.[23][24][25] At the time, incumbent Prime Minister Claude Joseph took control of the government, with the backing of the military, and was acknowledged by the United States as the rightful prime minister.[26]
A group of prominent diplomats to Haiti called the ""Core Group"", which is made up of ambassadors to Haiti from Brazil, the European Union, France, Germany, Spain and the United States, in addition to representatives to Haiti from the Organization of American States and the United Nations, called on Henry to take charge as the head of the government on 17 July.[27] On 19 July, Joseph announced that he will stand down as prime minister in favor of Henry.[26]

yrvj36,https://www.reddit.com/user/mais1silva,34,"Let me tell this to you as a Brazilian from one of the poorest if not the poorest region of the country/continent: you go and manage coming reaching head of state level in a neocon bourgeoisie dystopian hell like Brazil and implement even the timidest socialist-oriented policy and see what happens to you and how mucn manoeuvre you have. Lula comes from extreme poverty - if you know his biography you know that, literal-starvation-with-no-access-to-water-and-electricity-and-no-literacy level - and has twice in his life being jailed. Once he stopped by in my hometown while in the presidency, in December 2009 to be exact, when he inaugurated there the biggest social housing project of the region's history, and during the ceremony he spoke in of the least 'diplomatic' speeches of his carrer I personally ever saw: ""All the resistance and fury you see always coming at these policies are against the people getting mere crumbs and scraps; you would dream not of what would be done to it and the people were they more than just that. The people live in literal shit, and all I want is to raise you out of it. I don't care who is in power here. I know how the poor people of this country live and I am determined to change history.""  
This is the same region and elite who killed Árbenz Guzmán and Salvador Allende when they were striving for the most basic social-economic changes. In my opinion it takes a lot of naiveté and presumption for any internet ""revolutionary"" to deligitimize a working class leader such as Lula, who fought insanely hard his entire life on behalf of the poor and workers even during a brutal dictatorship, as not a socialist. ""We live in a society"", says the meme, and historical realism and material conditions is a thing if I remember. He founded a party called Workers Party whose symbol is a red star and he has in every single election run in a coallition with the Communist Party of Brazil. Sure, he is not a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary, nor does he pretend to be one, but again, he self-identifies as a Socialist in Brazilian realpolitik and in my opinion he has a biography to back it up, regardless of anybody else's purist and personal definition of a socialist here.

Is there any actual assurance that China will become socialist? Are they going to hand over the means of production to the proletariat when they become the largest capitalist powerhouse in the world? Wouldn't that just stiffle their ability to trade and operate within a capitalist world?
Or are they trying to suck all the financial capital from the entire planet and then give it to the Chinese proletariat? If so, what about the other 80% of humanity that had all financial capital removed and still live in capitalist hellscapes?

The term nazi originated as an amalgamation from their German name. Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei. 
They added socialism to the name to appeal to more working class Germans, something which Hitler himself was against doing. 
Despite the name, National Socialist Party, they don't practice any form of socialism in actuality and focus on Nationalist ideals instead. Which itself is fundamentally counter to socialism. 
The names an oxymoron that was adopted to appeal to a wider audience and make their nationalist agenda more palatable to working Germans.

This isn't true, no costumes are really offensive. The only ones people seem to get upset about are Nazis, blackface, and modern serial killers that were active recently.

I understand Halloween to be an embracing of obscenity and absurdity

I doubt many Americans would characterize it this way & even obscenity is fine, but this isn't an obscene little joke that is benign. This is dressing up as a nazi. Don't forget we have had Nazis marching in our streets from before WW2 to the present & they call for the purging (one way or another) of what would be around 1/3 of the US today. I'm black so I'm especially not fucking with this Nazi shit. White supremacy is the reality in the US & you learn that fast growing up not white. Nazis aren't a joke it's that simple really. Can't be absurd and obscene when nazism is still a thing globally & domestically.
Maybe SA has not had so many open Nazis. I could see that because of the demographics. If the guy truly isn't racist he will reconsider after this video, if he is then he knows how people feel about him.

The occupation, a chapter 7 deployment of a UN Stabilizing military force to Haiti (with the acronym MINUSTAH), was brutal and wreaked havoc on the Haitian community, who had to suffer homicides, rapes, beatings, and a cholera epidemic that killed approximately 30,000 people.

ypjasm,https://www.reddit.com/user/Loki-Gwynbleidd,23,"A poster depicting an otter destroying a phonograph that broadcasts hate speech.
I had planned to publish this poster a few weeks ago but I had a lot of trouble and now it comes in a particular context about freedom of speech on the Internet.
The message is very simple: conspiratorial, reactionary and hateful ideas should not be discussed or put forward. They are already widely dominant in many parts of society and to want to fight them on the ""marketplace of ideas"" only makes them commonplace. Is it necessary to recall the concrete consequences of these speeches on the lives of many people ?
[Image description]
A landscape format poster inspired by the style and printing techniques of the 1870s-1880s, with bold strokes, pointillism and false flaws. The image is as if printed on a paper whose grain can be seen.
It depicts an otter sitting behind a cylinder phonograph screaming hateful messages. The whole in a decoration with blue, brown, yellow and green tints.
The device rests on a rather large wooden base on which one can read the text ""Hate Speech Manufactoring"". Its mechanism is made of brass and is particularly visible. One can notice a dial with settings on ""conspiracy, hatred, violence"". The device reads a green cylinder on which one guesses the term ""transphobia"". The horn of the phonograph has a vociferous mouth instead of the usual hole.
The otter behind the device has a light brown and white coat. It wears a black cap and a bandolier, both with anti-fascist and anti-racist badges. She holds a hammer made of wood, stone, and creeper above her head to strike the phonograph. With her right hand, she twists the bell of the device.
There are no set elements around this scene, we can just notice the shape of the shadow cast by the otter as well as boxes and pieces of wax cylinders (green). These have labels that recall sexism and bigrotry, racism and white supremacism, anti-Semitism, hate speech and validism (antivax). By their condition, we understand that they have been destroyed by the otter.
At the top left of the image, a text written at an angle and in large irregular characters says ""Don't Debate Hate"".
Just below in text written in very large, sharp serif type answers ""Silence it"".
The text reads ""Don't debate hate, Silence it.""
Text to the right of the otter and his hammer reads in sans serif type ""Giving fascist a platform? That's otter nonsense!""
A few vegetal flourishes embellish the image, which is entirely surrounded by a wide band with geometric or wave-shaped friezes.

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. — In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.""

If you're telling a minority to drop the ""identity politics"" so that we can bring in bigots, that's class reductionist. 
If you're message is ""Abandon bigotry, and we can fight for a better future together,"" I think that's just building solidarity. 
As you pointed out, divides of race, gender, queerness, and etc. are a well-used tool to divide and conquer the working class. As long as capitalists exist, they will continue to use that tool. Conversely, we can use class solidarity to fight bigotry if it's in a would-be bigots best interest. 
Picketing alongside black coworkers doesn't destroy racism, but it lets you approach them as an ally to educate them. Socialism won't automatically destroy racism, but it removes a driving force behind it.

Who controls English language based media at large? If only an estimated 13% of the world's population speaks English and only a sliver use social media, why is this situation so disproportionately covered in the news?

Meanwhile, more concrete capital can cook the planet, while all of us know it, and still make record profits. There's no shaming that kind of power away, unfortunately.

However, the reason his partnerships were revoked is not stated as an accumulation of his behaviour, but because he was an anti-Semite -
Because of a social-media movement lead by an Adidas employee that was Jewish. The fact that anti-Semitism is associated with Nazism and given its own buzzword category (as opposed to bigotry or xenophobia) and that it is treated as the worst form of hate crime - indicates that there is an influential Jewish sphere in the first place - as does him getting away with so much until now. Kanye mentioning that they are in control, and being punished for, it is kind of an ironic perpetuating spiral.
