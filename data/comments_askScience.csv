y5tlmo,https://www.reddit.com/user/Tasty-Fox9030,5432,"There are a lot of ways you can estimate the population of a species. In fisheries we usually do surveys exactly the same way every year to get a general idea of the population size and trends, and mark recapture studies. If you tag 100 Cod and then next year you catch 100 Cod and three are tagged, that would suggest that you tagged about 3% of the population. Actually it's a lot more complicated because you have to correct for things like the tag causing mortality but that's the gist.
The big one though is catch per unit effort. You track the number of boats fishing in a certain way, how many hours they spend fishing, and how much they catch. If it takes three days at sea for a guy with a fishing rod to catch a Cod one year, and the next year it takes six, the population was probably cut in half.
Obviously 100 fish or one guy with a rod is a tiny, tiny number compared to the amount of data that actually gets collected- it's usually tens of thousands of tags or data from every fishing boat in a fishery. Even that ends up being a tiny sample of a commercially harvested species numbers though, so often fisheries management ends up depending on fairly imprecise estimates of population sizes. It's far better than managing with no data at all though, and a drop of 90% is large enough that they're almost certainly right that the fishery is imploding. ☹️

They may also track how many teeny tiny baby crabs they find in plankton, which is one predictor of how many bigger ones there will be later in the year (we do this for fish, aimingassuming it's possible for crabs too).
Probably they use this kind of information, plus climate predictions and sea temperature etc and run models to see how many adults there are likely to be available to the fishery
Normally the models have been tested over many years so scientists understand how reliable the results are/how much wiggle room there is, and take that into account when recommending catch limits

These surveys don't cover this area and some think that, thanks to warm oceans the last few years and the cold blob not extended very far south (basically very cold bottom temps) fish and crab are more likely to migrate and move around.

The guys with gillnets or draggers yeah they just don't like anybody. I think it's part of the culture. 
I met a bunch of guys that were REALLY friendly and cooperative. I also observed a boat once that was largely crewed by members of the Aryan brotherhood and they indeed did hate everyone. 
The folks I know that observed in both Alaska and New England swear it's very very different. I think part of it is the relative newness of a lot of the regulatory programs in NE and part of it is that people getting rich are usually happier than people that are struggling and the NE fishermen are typically not making crab boat money. The scallopers pretty much ARE and most of them are nice in my experience. I also found that small boats that were mostly generational fishermen tended to be pretty on board with the program. Boats that were just a bunch of angry messed up people did exist and they hated us haha.

Ecosystems or species can be lot more fragile than many people assume

More confusingly - many natural systems have substantial buffers, which can absorb change until they are used up at which point change becomes extremely sudden.
In humans, for instance, you can live normally with 2-3% kidney function and not know it. If you have a condition that's causing you to lose 1% kidney function a month, you'll only start having noticeable symptoms after 8 years, at which point you have perhaps a month to halt the degradation before you lose the kidney.
In the ocean, calcium carbonate functions as a buffer (disclaimer: not a chemist, will get some terminology wrong), preventing the water becoming more acidic by disassociating and bonding to the acid. As a result, the PH of the ocean basically doesn't change even as you add huge amounts of acidic CO2 - but the reduced calcium carbonate availability weakens the bones & shells of marine creatures. If that buffer runs low enough, the ocean will very rapidly become acidic.

y5tlmo,https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Discussion2246,50,"To touch on the climate part and the fragility of ocean life & ecosystems and how it effects it. I’ll give you a good example. 
Have you ever had a fish tank? The most common (and easier to maintain) type is freshwater, which is what I keep and have more experience with. I currently have 4. A 30 gallon, a 10 gallon, and 2 5 gallons. They all have substrate(dirt), sand, and live plants. 
Now the most important thing in keeping fish, is maintaining the correct water parameters. Certain types of fish need certain parameters/environments in order to not only live, but breed. Some are heartier than others and can live in wider ranges. Same goes for breeding. My 30 gallon tank is easiest to maintain those parameters since there’s more water & it will take more time for the parameters to change enough to harm or kill the fish. The smaller tanks can be tricky, since the less water, the quicker and more drastic the parameters can change. I’f you’re not careful the fish could be dead in less than 24 hrs if there’s an issue with said parameters, or heat, and the whole tanks ecosystem can “crash” pretty fast afterwards. And the crazy part is, it doesn’t take all that much of a variance to wreck an ecosystem. Sure these are small, man made ecosystems. But it’s an excellent example of just how fragile they can be.
Now saltwater tanks. Those are pretty advanced in most cases. The only reasons I haven’t gotten into that are because they are incredibly expensive to set up (a decent size is going to cost you thousands) and expensive and difficult to maintain. Go check out r/reeftank and check out beginner info to see what goes into it. Even big tanks require a lot of maintaining to just keep everything alive and the water balanced. It’s another excellent example because it’s a little slice of our ocean. Check out the posts about tank crashes and whatnot. You’ll see all sorts of reasons. Heater broke and couldn’t replace it fast enough? Dead fish. Heater malfunctioned and was running 2-3 degrees hotter? Dead. Used some sort of cheap plastic decoration? The chemicals leached out of it into the water, dead fish. The seemingly smallest things can send these small tiny micro slices of ocean down a death spiral at the drop of a hat. 
Seriously check out aquarium communities and their failures and accidents. It takes a ton of effort to create and maintain a functional ecosystem by hand, and we have various chemicals to help us do it (fish tanks, not the ocean). The ocean is no different, it’s just a MUCH bigger tank. 
So yeah, ocean life (all life really), and ecosystems are incredibly fragile. 
It’s pretty sad, ocean life now is a husk of what it was just a century or two ago. Overfishing is a huge issue. But it’s pollution and general mistreatment is the bigger one that’s going to be harder to come back from. We’re unfortunately going to start seeing more and more issues over the next decade (and likely forever)

The margins of error on population size estimates for most fisheries stocks are huge compared to just about any other quantitative science. There's an interesting story about the New England ground fish stocks about that one- basically the vast majority of fishing boats in New Bedford MA were owned by one company, that company deliberately mislabeled a large proportion of their stocks for many years, and now the stock assessments are all messed up because the historical data they would use for CPUE estimates are useless.

First, it is unfortunate that ""fish move around under the water where we cannot see them,"" but is that because the fishery managers do not have the most sophisticated sonar that the factory trawlers must. I mean, the captain of the trawlers isn't just throwing his net in on a hunch. And second, do the managers track CPUE on the factory trawlers and is that on the rise. The reason I ask is that the Bering Sea ecosystem has to be interconnected and if the factory trawlers continue to take tens of millions of pounds of (bycatch) potential food  out of the crab habitat that could explain a drop in numbers. I don't mean to belittle the acidification or warming temperatures arguments, but the Pollock/cod fishery has almost doubled their quota in the last 15 years and that doesn't seem to be listed as the major cause of crab, halibut, sealion or salmon stocks decline.

If there is that much monitoring going on, shouldn’t we be able to track most species fairly accurately

There is a lot of monitoring, but the ocean is giant and there is always considerable uncertainty in any fisheries research/monitoring/estimation. Think of it this way
Your goal is to estimate the total number of trees in National Forests. You can monitor the number of board feet of lumber harvested every year, but that varies with permits the govt gives out, and market demand. 
You're also given 100 staff to go out in the field and can count trees. But they have to do it at night, with flashlights. And also, the trees move around after you count them
That's what fisheries monitoring is like even in the best scenarios

y5tlmo,https://www.reddit.com/user/NthHorseman,23,"They survey multiple locations repeatedly over years. If a specific patch of ocean normally has (say) 1000 crabs in it and now its only got 10 then that might just be a local problem or migration. If they survey 100 different random locations and almost all of them have far fewer crabs than normal then that it's unlikely to be a local problem; it's an ecosystem-wide one.
As for how they arrive at the figure: it's an approximation based on the total area that they know crabs live(d) in, and the density they observed crabs in similar areas. If in previous surveys they have looked at 100 random 100m2 areas found an average of 10 crabs in each, then this year they look again and find an average of 1 crab in each, they can extrapolate that 90% of the crabs are gone with a high degree of confidence without having to look everywhere or count every crab. They can put a number to this by using the difference in density of crabs (1-0.1) and multiplying it by the area they previously occupied.
In practice it's a little more complicated, as different areas of the seafloor will have different crab-densities and extents, so you could use a more sophisticated model to examine each environment individually and likely get a more accurate value (as they have done in this study), but the principle is the same.

Lots of people here have done a good job of covering how data is collected.  There are a myriad of sources and they’re often all used in conjunction when doing a population assessment like this.  
Likewise, several people have brought up points of skepticism, like “how do we know it just wasn’t a bad year?” And that’s valid. There is population stochasticity every year. The key to figuring out whether or not there’s an actual issue is looking at many years of previous data, and figuring out the variation around a prediction of populations. That way, you can quantify the uncertainty around your population estimate.  
What we have with the snow crabs is a decline of unprecedented magnitude, far beyond the expected variation based on previous years.  Consequently, we can be fairly certain that there’s a directional decline, or at the very least, a mass migration out of traditional fisheries. Not just “a bad year”.

Why did all marine mammals evolve to have horizontal tail fins while all(?) fish evolve to have vertical ones?

Both cetaceans (whales n' dolphins) and sirenians (manatees n' dugongs) have horizonal tail flukes because, being mammals, they've evolved from terrestrial beasties which had an erect posture (legs directly underneath the body) and whose spines can only really articulate along the vertical axis. 
You're the same. You can bend forward super easily; but side to side? TresTrès difficile! Given evolution only works with what's given to it, the path of least resistance was to evolve swimming biomechanics that utilised a pre-existing up n' down motion.
Conversely, lateral undulation is a basal trait amongst vertebrates - fish, amphibian, and all extant reptile spines articulate 'side-to-side' (with legs splayed out). Hence why they all - be it asalmon, salmonsea snake or a crocodile - similarly swim with lateral undulation, utilising vertical tail flukes or spines (the direction of the fluke obviously designed to maximise fluid resistance and thereby drive propulsion).
But why did mammals (and dinosaurs for that matter) develop a vertical posture? There are multiple hypotheses, the most convincing associated with something called the Carrier's constraint. Lizards and other laterally undulating terrestrial beasties find it more difficult to move and breathe at the same time, as the sideways flexing of their gait impedes the ability of their lungs to expand and contract fully - hence why you usually spot 'em darting about in short bursts, with pauses to catch their breath. Having vertically-articulating spines overcomes this limitation.
Indeed, a reason why dinosaurs were so successful and outcompeted most other reptile clades induring the earlyLate Triassic was because of this; the shift to a bipedal gait via things like Lagosuchus through to Eoraptor produced a group of animals that could move about far more efficiently, making them extremely effective predators. A similar trajectory is observed in early mammals (though perhaps more as a means to avoid predation, more efficiently escaping dinosaur jaws, than the other way around).
In summary: evolutionEvolution only moulds what it's already been given. Whales descend from vertically postured beastiescritters, and so their only option was to develop vertically-orientatedarticulating horizontal flippery-bits. Everything else in the sea inherited the default option, which was side-to-side.

P.S. As a note, there are no fully aquatic dinosaurs (non-avian or otherwise), so no horizontal flukes to observe - the closest thing, the semi-aquatic spinosaurids, I believe, relied on vertically-inclined paddling much more than undulation - palaeontologists, correct me if I'm wrong!
P.P.S. Second note, the vertical articulation of mammal spines also explains why there are no legless mammals (despite some claims about Proterix having no legs) - sideways undulation is much more conducive for trajectories towards limblessness and burrowing. Alas!

The evolutionary trajectories are reasonably well understood (see here for overview), but in short, cetaceans descend from small omnivorous mousedeer-like ungulates, that scampered about on wee hoof-like legs. They eventually become a bit more otter-ey,  spending increasingly more time in aquatic environments - their limbs become more fin-like, their nostrils migrate to the tops of their skulls, and their hindlimbs disappear almost entirely. A few more rounds of optimisation, and you get the foundation of modern whales bobbing about ~35ish million years ago - one group (Odontoceti) retaining teeth and eventually developing echolocation, the other (Mysticeti) maxing out on the baleen and going full filter-mode.

I attended a talk on this very topic a couple weeks ago. The presenter had done some research on the evolutionary response of coastal sedges in response to rising sea levels. They were able to show a response large enough to affect the ecosystem, at least partially maintaining its integrity, but it's hard to say whether that will be enough to prevent collapse in the long term.
On a less encouraging note, different anthropogenic disturbances may exert different pressures on different timescales. For example, fertilizer runoff increases nitrogen availability in wetlands, promoting shorter roots in plants, which acts against selection for longer root systems to slow erosion due to higher mean sea level.

This is incorrect. Humans can get all necessary amino acids from plant based sources.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893534/

The claim that certain plant foods are “missing” specific amino acids is demonstrably false. All plant foods contain all 20 amino acids, including the 9 indispensable amino acids [33]. Importantly, rather than “missing” indispensable amino acids, a more accurate statement would be that the amino acid distribution profile is less optimal in plant foods than in animal foods

There are aquatic dinosaurs! Birds like penguins, loons, ducks, etc. are all aquatic dinosaurs. As for earlier dinosaurs, well, we don’t know for sure. We can tell some things based on morphology, or even where the animal was fossilized, but it can be challenging. As far as I know, there are no known unambiguously aquatic dinosaurs until birds took to the water. 
As for marine reptiles like plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and so on, those aren’t dinosaurs. Mosasaurs are squamates, related to lizards. Plesiosaurs are their own order, if my memory serves, within the larger group Sauropterygia. None are archosaurs, the larger group that includes crocs and dinosaurs, let alone dinosaurs. I actually really enjoy that because it points to this really cool, broader diversity. 
Also, another similar point of confusion is that pterosaurs aren’t dinosaurs, either! They are somewhat closely related, but they’re a separate group.

Avian dinosaurs have essentially a thin rigid lung for gas exchange, like a radiator, with air sacs like bellows. This is massively different from squamata lungs. This trait appears to have occurred after the split off crocodilia, since modern Crocs use a hepatic piston to move air, rather than lateral undulation. Most of the croc's undulation is in its tail.
I assumed all dinosaur lungs were bird lungs, although I don't know about sauropods and ornithischia. It seems like all of these archosaurs didn't use lateral undulation for respiration, but they developed different kinds of lungs. I don't understand how a vertically articulating spine helps in respiration.
Like protosuchus had a mobile pubis and used pelvic aspiration, but I don't understand why this applies to Crocs. Crocs breathe just fine without moving their ribs unlike squamata or caudata. It seems the advantage for lateral undulation for a croc is that it usually is at the surface, where vertical undulation would be inefficient.
I also don't understand how Carrier's constraint differentiates between mammals and non mammals. Protomammals like dimetredon had similar posture to many modern squamata. Monitor lizards, Crocs, iguanas, mammals, birds, all have different mechanisms of respiration, yet mammals are the ones that have vertical spine articulation.

yjb5rl,https://www.reddit.com/user/tea_and_biology,21,"I should probably stop procrastinating and get back to doing 'real' science, but to quickly sum up initial off-the-cuff thoughts:

Having to navigate complicated three-dimensional spaces requires a little more brain power than a two-dimensional field; arboreality (living in trees) ought to provide more opportunities for trajectories towards 'higher intelligence'. Ditto underwater environments, and complicated reef ecosystemsarchitecture.
Trajectories towards sociality also help a lot. Navigating complex social environments, dominance hierarchies, relationships and politics etc. all requires better memory and processing power.
Having a wider generalist / omnivorous diet also helps a lot; and/or a diet that is highly seasonal and/or dispersed. Requiring more processing power to test foods, remember which ones are edible, and when/where they appear etc.
Doesn't take a lot of RAM to process eating a whole load of ferns, which were everywhere. 
Having limbs conducive to tool use / acute environmental manipulation opens up a lot of possibilities too. 
Overlapping generations; being able to not only learn but culturally pass on information is crucial. This is the fatal flaw of the octopus. Given octopussies die just as their brood hatches, every single octopus generation has to reinvent the wheel, essentially. Progress is halted.
Being endothermic (or equivalent). Maintaining processing power at a constant speed is much better than a brain which slows up and speeds down with environmental fluctuation.

Primates tick all the above, so it's no surprise they incubated our intellectual development. Elephants, dolphins, corvids tick most, but not all. As for the non-avian dinosaurs? Well, few, really.
I'm kind of surprised there wasn't a successful group of arboreal dinosaurs akin to post-Cretaceous primates. Perhaps it's due to how flowering plants (and associated fruits) didn't massively radiate until the early-to-mid-Cretaceous not that long before they all went extinct, so there wasn't as much diverse abundance of opportunity to exploit up in the canopy. Or something to do with how their digits weren't conducive to the sort of manipulation required for climbing and, more importantly, tool use (then again, there were a few semi-arboreal small theropods, like microraptorMicroraptor). Or somethingthere elsesimply waswasn't alreadythe tooright dominantfoundational material for evolution to work upon (""Your hands don't pronate? Aww, shucks. Nothing to work with here!"").

yjb5rl,https://www.reddit.com/user/Stewart_Games,9,"I'd argue that dentition - and the advantages that early mammals had over the diapsids in that field - played a major role. Early mammals outcompeted dinosaurs to the arboreal niches, in part because synapsids have better dentition for gnawing. Dinosaurs simply had no answer to ""how do I eat a pinecone?"", whereas multituberculata had that whole ""gigantic incisors"" thing on lock. 
Basically, the mammals were just better at climbing trees and eating seeds than the dinosaurs, and cut the archosaurs - apart from birds - out of that niche. 
I'd also add to your list that intelligence is more likely to evolve from orders that have been around a long, long time. Primates are actually one of the oldest surviving orders of mammals, with probable origins dating back 85 million years ago. I argue that longevity of the order increases the odds of intelligence appearing within it, because the conditions required to favor intelligence over other obvious evolutionary strategies like a larger body size are quite rare in nature. So the older an order is, the more chances there would be for those conditions to arise. 
This isn't something we can really prove, though - at least, not unless we happen to find other alien intelligences and can compare their evolutionary origins to our own.

In summary: Evolution only moulds what it's already been given.

That's one thing I've never understood. I hear it said all the time, but if that's true then how did animals initially diversify in the first place? Arthropods didn't start out with exoskeletons, and fish didn't start as vertebrates. So what caused this diversification, if not evolution? Furthermore, if evolution previously caused this diversification, why doesn't it still occur?

Evolution doesn't magic into existence a whole new thing.

Eventually that change could be in the whole population. But then that initial mutation could be mutated further.

Because the first walking fish that evolved would always walk side to side which would always result in the walkafish walking in a direction that would not afford the perspective achieved with stereoscopic vision. 
It is conjectured that the walkafish could very often see things, having one eye on each side of their head, but not be able to gauge the distance to the thing.
Conversely the walkadolphin had both eyes facing forwards in the vector that it could walk or retreat from.
The combination of motivation in a direction where depth could be perceived turned out to be a powerful new adaptation that provided benefit beyond the trade off cost of not always maintaining a 360 degree view of the surroundings.
So basically the walkadolphins ate all the walkafish.

ymqdnn,https://www.reddit.com/user/aTacoParty,6509,"The cells in your body will die at different rates depending on their energy requirements. Cells that require a lot of oxygen to survive (eg neurons) will die within 5 minutes of the heart stopping. Other cells, like your skin cells, can live on for hours or even 1-2 days. 
But will they get sunburned? That depends on what you call a ""sunburn"". Yes they still have DNA and are producing mRNA which can be damaged by UV rays from the sun. However, the pain, redness, and swelling that is associated with sunburns is due to release of inflammatory signals, vasodilation (capillaries opening), and edema (fluid rushing in). There will probably still be release of inflammatory signals, and vasodilation, but without circulating blood there would be no edema and no additional immune cells likely resulting in no change in appearance of the skin. 
In short, the skin cells will still get damaged but the skin won't flush as you would see in someone who is alive.

I can't tell you exactly what would change in the responding immune cells, as it would be mostly the same, but the extra ""DNA damage"" signals probably have at least some impact.

Yeah, since sun damage is so common, and the kind of damage is pretty different from a heat burn, we've evolved ways of dealing with it. Melanin does help prevent DNA damage, so your body wants to make more as a preventative. The flip side is that it also reduces how much vitamin D your body can make (UV light converts cholesterols into the vitamin), so your body only wants the minimum amount of melanin needed to protect it from DNA damage. 
So, there are survival benefits if you can fine tune the melanin levels. One reason our cells have particular chemical signals specific to DNA damage. Another reason is that DNA damage happens a lot when cancer is developing. It helps your immune system prevent cancers, if those cells announce themselves, at least for a little while.

We’ve used it a bunch in the tropics and I swear it works. What I’ve been told is that even after you’ve gotten out of the sun, the UV damage itself is still continuing like a bunch of little bombs that keep going off, but the vinegar helps to slow and/or stop that from continuing. The earlier you can put it on after you’ve gotten out of the Sun, the more effective it will be, up to a point where it’s been too long that at some point like the next morning, it won’t have any effect. What I feel like I’m reading above is that it’s actually the body’s reaction at removing and replacing those damaged cells, which maybe the vinegar is playing a roll in tampering the body’s reaction, thus limiting the final severity of the burn.

ymqdnn,https://www.reddit.com/user/dave-the-scientist,1,"Hmmm, I can't really say for sure about vinegar. Most of the damage from UV happens pretty much right away, when some photon hits certain molecules in just the right way. It just breaks those molecules apart. It can also lead to the production of free radicals, which are toxic, but those get used up right away. Once you're out of the sun, there won't be much damage that continues.
I think you're right with the second thought, that it could help reduce how strongly your own body reacts to the burn. I don't know for sure if it does, but that's how aloe vera helps. It acts as an anti-inflammatory. A whole lot of our injuries are actually from our immune system overreacting, so that certainly would make sense.

To expand on this a little and to provide a concrete example, ever had a sore, swollen throat? It's not the virus causing you pain. It's your body flooding the area with fluid and white blood cells. Ever had an infection? Pus is (generally) the accumulation of dead white blood cells (sent there to fight the bacteria or virus) and the dead bacteria or virus they kill.

ymqdnn,https://www.reddit.com/user/aTacoParty,2,"Interestingly, they stop firing pretty quickly. In studies in mice and rats they found that cortical neurons will stop firing in under a minute when the flow of oxygen is stopped. This is thought to be a method of conserving energy (ATP) by halting non-essential functions (IE everything except certain parts of the brain stem). Once ATP is depleted, neurons are no longer able to maintain their ion gradient and the leakage of sodium into the cells causes one massive depolarization where nearly all neurons fire at the same time. This last depolarization causes a lot of damage as there are no longer working mechanisms to recover (neurotransmitter transporters, glial cell support, etc). 
There's a really interesting study done in patients who had electrodes already implanted for neuromonitoring after an aneurysm or traumatic brain injury that were removed from life support (decision made by the physician and family, not the researchers). The researchers could start measuring electrical activity before life support was withdrawn and watch what happened when the heart stopped beating. They saw very similar sequence of events as the research in rodents (depression of activity followed by a synchronized depolarization).
In rodents this synchronized depolarization happens after ~2 minutes, in humans they saw it occur ~7 minutes.

Another hypothesis is that DMT, an endogenous compound as well as the psychoactive component in ayahuasca , is released when a person is dying. Those who take DMT recreationally often report very similar experiences to those who have a near death experience. For example, reviewing memories, meeting god, feeling like you're floating out of your body.

""Cellular activity"" is a little vague but it can refer to a lot of different things like cell division in stem cells, hormone production in certain endocrine cells, and electrical activity in neurons. 
Neurons require ATP to drive ions across their membrane to maintain the resting potential which is required for action potentials (IE firing) which can happen hundreds of times a second. Motor neurons are actually some of the largest cells in your body as their nucleus sits up in your cortex and their axons stretch down into your lower spinal cord. This means they need to maintain a massive amount of plasma membrane, and cellular machinery which all requires oxygen (via mitochondrial OXPHOS). 
Compare that to red blood cells that do not even have mitochondria as they rely solely on glycolysis for their ATP source and are able to function regardless of oxygen levels. Their main function is to transport oxygen which relies on partial pressures, and pH, rather than ATP-dependent processes (mostly). This ends up being quite useful as your body needs red blood cells to be functioning in low-oxygen environments as they are the cells that will help oxygenate those areas.

For example excess mucus from the common cold can lead to an ear or sinus infection because the mucus created becomes a breeding ground for other bacteria when it doesn't drain properly similar to how a stagnant body of water breeds bacteria better than a flowing river.

Also: you want to cough if it's ""productive,"" i.e. coughing up mucus from your lungs, but if you're coughing from an irritated throat, it will just irritate it further, and that's when you want to take cough medicine.

When you blow your nose you're actually at risk of pushing mucus into your paranasal sinus - which might actually lead to more problems than you had before, e.g. sinus or ear infections.
""Snorting the snot back"" actually snorts it into your throat and mouth upon which you can swallow it, meaning the mucus goes into your stomach and gets killed off rather quickly - rather than staying in your respitory or sinus areas.
Another advantage of not blowing your nose is that you're not actively spreading any germs and viruses to 'outside' your body.

In short, it is becoming apparent that fever resucers for children can cause more harm that previously believed. 
And for fevers,  small children can handle higher fevers for longer periods than adults.
Fevers with infections don't cause brain damage. Only temperatures above 108° F (42° C) can cause brain damage. It's very rare for the body temperature to climb this high. It only happens if the air temperature is very high. An example is a child left in a closed car during hot weather.

My fever was the only symptom. If I had suppressed it and pushed through even a day longer I'd be no more because it was close already with the weeks of coma, surgery to remove enough tissue from my arm to see the skin on the other side, multiple IV antibiotics that failed to combat the infection,  5 week hospital stay and months of recovery. 
104 isn't going to be detrimental to an adult unless they have a disease that will be made worse by heat. (Various autoimmune disease and quite a few skin diseases hate heat and will flare like crazy from fevers). 104 in a small child or infant is a different story and they should be given fever reducers.

OTC analgesics and opiates certainly have their place. But both should only ever be used short term because long term they do more harm than good.

I even developed coughing techniques (in private!) designed to loosen and clear mucus from particular areas of my lungs that normal coughing seemed to bypass.
So, it puzzles me why so many people with deep, rattly coughs only ever seem to cough in a shallow fashion that does nothing to clear the deeper areas of the lungs.   I'll admit, it does take some effort, so maybe they haven't got the stamina or can't be bothered.

Coughing helps clear out mucus so that it can be removed from your lungs. If you don't cough enough or hard enough, though, the mucus may end up getting stuck in your throat. This can cause an infection called bronchitis or pneumonia.

The disease is the accumulation of mucus; breaking down the mucous membrane, and that mucous covering groups of cells in your body. For example, we have the mucous membrane in the body to protect us from the onslaught of aerobic bacteria—nonetheless, the mucous membrane is for protection of the body. We eat acid foods and the acid food breaks down the mucous membrane and cause mucus to flow with the blood covering other groups of cells that belong to organs, and depriving them of oxygen. If the mucus goes to your nostrils, they called it sinusitis; if the mucus goes to your bronchial tube, they called it bronchitis; if the mucus goes to the lungs, they called it pneumonia. Mucus in your eyes will also cause vision problems (Dr. Sebi).
So, you have three different diseases caused by mucus. So, what about when the mucus goes to the prostate gland, its prostatitis. When the mucus goes to the uterus of a woman, they called it endometriosis or vaginal discharge or yeast infection. So, we have this mucus situation, which produces all of those diseases caused by an inadequate diet. Mucus is the underline cause of all diseases.

yakkhb,https://www.reddit.com/user/b7XPbZCdMrqR,1541,"""Postviral fatigue syndrome"" or ""chronic fatigue syndrome"" (CFS) are typically used as a more general name for this sort of condition, and it can be triggered by almost any viral infection (including the common cold and the flu). There's no reason to believe that SARS would be any different. It's debatable whether everything classified as CFS is the same thing, but there's certainly a large set of overlapping symptoms.
This paper (2005) discusses some post-viral symptoms and possible treatments for previously-infected SARS patients. The paper makes a comparison to CFS, but does not directly state they are the same - instead it just places ""Post-SARS sickness syndrome"" in the same category of conditions. This 2011 paper alsofollows talksup abouton 22 post-SARS patients who are experiencing persistent chronic symptoms in post-SARS patients. Whatever you want to call the syndrome, this is the most direct answer I could find to your question.

This is recently being called into question.
https://molmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10020-022-00548-8

Long-COVID has been compared to Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which is an overwhelming fatigue that is not improved by rest and worsened by any physical or mental exertion. Our data suggests that Long-COVID is biochemically distinct from ME/CFS as all 14 vascular transformation biomarkers increased significantly in plasma from Long-COVID patients when compared to healthy control subjects.

AgreedMostly agreed. These problems certainly seem unique in their specifics and severity, at least.

The taste and smell abnormalities are fairly unique and affect different receptor systems.

Agreed, generally. There are classes of post-viral syndromes that frequently yield both chronic fatigue and attenuation of taste/smell. But again, agreed, the specifics are likely different or at least not identical.

The cytokine stuff will have several final path away outcomes

Of course. And we actually see this in great deal in mast cell disorders, where the relationship between overactivation of various inflammatory pathways is closely linked to chronic fatigue and episodic exacerbations.

but saying, lol everyone who is kind of tired is the same is a bad idea

This is an oversimplification. Whether the links between the individual viruses and chronic fatigue should be evaluated individually or collectively is a function of what mechanisms are being explored. If we're evaluating the pathogenesis of long covid in particular, then yes, you tend to look at it in relative isolation. And if that exploration demonstrates a mechanistic root for fatigue based in CoV-2-specific vascular damage or the like, wonderful.
But if you are looking at things like the role of the host response in the pathogenesis of chronic fatigue, then it may well be of value to group multiple viruses together.
The long and the short of the answer is ""we don't know yet."" Both approaches are valid in certain circumstances. Ruling one or the other out at this time is premature, even if one personally happens to be absolutely sure that theira preferredparticular explanation (vascular damage or otherwise) is obvious and correct.

And they all have known areas of dysfunction that include breathing problems, lung lesions, pancreatic / endocrine regulation ect. Even influenza. There’s even a clinical theory and area of debate suggesting that type 1 diabetes is triggered as a post virtual syndrome in children. Covid isn’t entirely special in this regard.

I had lingering effects for months afterward, though. Less energy, not by an extreme amount but certainly noticeable, and some digestive issues that I’d never suffered from before. Again, nothing super extreme but definitely noticeable.

This is recently being called into question.
https://molmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10020-022-00548-8
Long-COVID has been compared to Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which is an overwhelming fatigue that is not improved by rest and worsened by any physical or mental exertion. Our data suggests that Long-COVID is biochemically distinct from ME/CFS as all 14 vascular transformation biomarkers increased significantly in plasma from Long-COVID patients when compared to healthy control subjects.

But, he said that the issue is that funding always dried up before really studies could take place for folks to understand the long term implications. Doctors could see what was happening and they could discuss it in journals or amongst themselves but it couldn't be accurately documented.

simply due to radiation

Well, bees aren't spending a lot of time around ionizing radiation. Especially queens who spend most of their lives inside colonies. But, sperm stores do lose viability. It's the primary cause of queensqueen failure. And, since sperm is not mitotic isit is not going to accumulate mutations through genome replication.

y8wwmc,https://www.reddit.com/user/amaurea,1,"This paints the picture of the queen only mating once per flight, needing the workers to remove the mating sign each time. Do you have a source for that? It doesn't match how I learnt it. I did a quick search for it now, and while I didn't find a very authoritative source, this is pretty typical for the many beekeeper web pages I found:

When ready to mate, she flies to what looks like a mini-swarm of male honey bees (drones), called a drone congregation area or drone assembly area.
Drones mount the queen mid-flight (high in the air).
The queen honey bee will mate several times, and research has indicated between 6 and 24 times during a mating flight. 
Each time the queen mates, she receives about 6 million spermatozoa from each male into her oviducts, from where 5.3 – 5.7 million spermatozoa are transported to the spermatheca.
The honey bee queen may take two or three mating flights.  Once the queen’s spermetheca (sperm sac) is full of sperm, the sperm will last her entire egg-laying lifetime.

Here's another one:

When a virgin queen flies to a site where thousands of male honey bees may be waiting, she mates with several males in flight. A male drone will mount the queen and insert his endophallus, ejaculating semen. After ejaculation, a male honey bee pulls away from the queen, though his endophallus is ripped from his body, remaining attached to the newly fertilized queen.
The next male honey bee to mate with the queen will remove the previous endophallus and eventually lose his own after ejaculation.

So while a mated queen does return to the hive with a mating sign, that's just the one that remained after the last drone it mated with. Drones were responsible for removing the others.

What keeps the new queen with the same hive instead of going out to found a new hive? Is it the lack of another established queen?

It's a lot of work and resources to start a new hive and they often don't make it.  They'd prefer to stay put.
Sometimes the hive will replace a queen that's still alive, but you don't get multiple queens because the new queens immediately try to kill the existing queen and any sibling queens that were recently born.  
The old queen will usually flee a little before the new queens are born, taking as many of the workers as they can with them (usually the older ones).  That's what makes a swarm, an overthrown queen trying to start a new hive.

Dunno about ants, but as a beekeeper I was trained to think of the entire colony as an organism, not the individual bees.  In order to spread its genes, the colony produces drones whose sole purpose is to mate with virgin queens from other colonies.  
Interestingly, all female honeybees are capable of producing eggs.  Uncapped brood (up to ~10 days old) in the hive release a pheromone that suppresses the ovaries of the female workers.  Typically when a hive become queenless for any reason, the workers select several recently-laid eggs to rear as new queens.  Occasionally, though, this process isn't successful...and without a laying queen, there are no more eggs for them to try again.  The colony at this point is doomed.  
However, without the suppressing pheromone from open brood, the workers in the colony will begin laying eggs.  Because they aren't mated, all these eggs are unfertilized and will develop into drones.  If you look at this from the perspective of the individual insects, it seems pointless...but those drones carry the colony's genes and can mate with other queens to carry on the bloodline.  It's the organism's (colony) last-ditch effort to perpetuate its DNA.

I forgot the second part of your question.  Drones are definitely seasonal.  Around this time of year, the queen stops laying drone eggs and the workers start evicting all the living drones from the hive.  They'll either starve or freeze.
As they get ready to overwinter, the queen will stop laying eggs entirely.  They'll seal up the hive with propolis and cluster together in a ""ball"" near the center, vibrating their wings enough to keep the queen and few remaining brood from freezing, surviving on their stored honey.  That's a lot easier to do without having to feed a bunch of do-nothing fatboys!  
Once the spring thaws arrive, the queen will start laying eggs again.  If the hive is healthy and thriving (lots of food stored, plenty of workers), the queen will produce lots of drones.

y8wwmc,https://www.reddit.com/user/PM_UR_PLATONIC_SOLID,0,"Queens run dry all the time because a queen can live for years. Queens don't control how much semen they get in their mating flights so some queens run dry sooner than others. Queens are rarely driven out of their hives, whether they are fertilized or not. So no, it doesn't happen rarely. Active beekeepers (like myself) continually monitor our hives so we know when to squish a dry queen and replace her. While a queen can decide whether or not to lay a drone, the point I made remains (which you clearly misunderstood while simultaneously agreeing): A drone is a bee made from an unfertilized egg. 
Your issue seems to be that you think drones are only intentional and queens never run out of sperm. I don't even know how this would be possible since a queen mating flights to hook up with drones and she can't control how many drones she meets on the flights, be it 1 or 20. I don't even want to try to imagine how that would work... like the first drone has to ""know"" no other drones are around and has to blow a load 20x larger? Ugh.  See what you did? You're so wrong that it has made my stomach churn. You have evoked a visceral response from a beekeeper. Congratulations?

So for the beekeepers its a sign that the hive needs a new queen when they see an increase in male bee numbers

Beekeeper here - what you say is true, but only out of season.  ColoniesHealthy willcolonies normally produce lots of drones during the spring flow, to increase the chances of one mating with a virgin queen on her nuptial flight.  Sometimes during late summer/early autumn as well.  This is how honeybee colonies reproduce.  
This time of year, as the weather cools down, we typically see the existing drones being evicted from the hives and inspecting the brood nest shows almost no new drones being reared.  So yeah, if I were to see lots of drone cells in my brood comb (easy to spot, as they're visibly larger), I'd know something wasn't right - either the queen was ""dry"" or the hive had gone queenless some time ago and failed to rear a new queen, resulting in the female workers laying eggs.  Since none of them are mated, all those eggs result in drones.

Bees do not admit members, male nor female, from other colonies into their hives. Guard bees will fight/kill invaders attempting to enter.

Both drones and workers ""drift"" between colonies. They sometimes fail to find their way back to the right one and aren't rejected, at least not always:

Beekeepers are usually aware that colonies at the ends of rows often ‘accumulate’ bees that have drifted when returning to the hive. In shared association apiaries some crafty beekeepers will site their colonies at the ends of rows to take advantage of the ‘generosity’ of other colonies. However, many beekeepers probably do not appreciate the extent to which drifting occurs. Pfeiffer and Crailsheim (1998) report that 13-42% of the population of a colony are ‘alien’ i.e. have drifted from adjacent hives, depending upon the time of season. Remember that drifting occurs in both directions simultaneously, so the overall numbers of bees in a colony may not be adversely affected (or boosted). In other studies Sekulja and colleagues (2014) showed that ~1% of marked bees drifted between colonies over a three day observation window. Interestingly, American foulbrood (AFB) infected bees drifted slightly more than uninfected bees. Spread of foulbroods during drifting is one reason the bee inspectors check nearby apiaries when there is an outbreak. These studies were all on workers where drifting primarily occurs during orientation flights before the bees become foragers. Drones drift two to three times more than workers (Free, 1958).

It does not happen because drones do not enter new colonies at all. They leave their birthplace to look for a queen, mate with her in the open, and die shortly after mating.

This is wrong. In honey bees, most drone mating flights are unsuccessful, so they keep flying out, looking for a virgin queen to mate with, and then return to try again. Sometimes they return to the wrong hive, and when they do they are not rejected. This is called drone drift and is one mechanism by which parasites and diseases spread between bee hives.
Source: Beekeper blogs, and this scientific article:

During the spring and summer mating season, drones emerge from the hive, perform orientation flights, and search for drone congregation areas for mating. This search may lead drones to return to their colony, drift to other colonies (vectoring diseases and parasites), or simply get lost to predation. In a low percentage of cases, the search is successful, and drones mate and die.

This is because when a bee from a different colony comes over it’s complete genome is added into the new mix and you can assume all of the traits are viable so it’s super effective! Another thing to think about is that yes there is one queen bee having a ton of kids so this also increases the effective genetic variation of each hive.

What your 8-year old is asking about is called ""ecological"" succession"" and is the process through which an area can go from bare rock to a rich forest over a hundred years. You can see the early stages of ecological succession all over the place, particularly in concrete urban areas that have been neglected and are in the early stages of colonisation. In fact your local hardware store will sell lots of products which are the armoury of the homeowner in the struggle against the primary colonisers of ecological succession.

Other minerals such as feldspar, ferromagesian minerals and mica breakdown via hydrolysis.

Significantly, early stages of weathering generates clay minerals in the fractures and cleavage planes of minerals. This causes minerals, especially mica, to expand. This breaks up the rock, facilitating further chemical weathering.

yqrs27,https://www.reddit.com/user/Bbrhuft,23,"I agree wth you that Regolith is unweathered unconsolidated material covering the surface of a planet, tyically found on parent bodies that lack and atmosphere and water, on the other hand soil is a peculiar subvariety of regolith that has undergone chemical weathering and leaching due to interaction with water on a planet that has an atmosphere. Life is not required (though it is required to form the top surficial organic rich A horizon of soils and organic soils e.g. Peat). 
Soil can form without life. I think you are familiar with soil that form predominantly via chemical weathering that lack organic material such as as Terra Rossa, a red clayey soil formed by the dissolution of limestone and (some postulate) an addition deposition of atmospheric dust, as well as tropical soils where chemical weathering and leaching is accelerated e.g. Latosols, Ultisols, Laterite, and Bauxite. There's also soils found in deserts, gravely Grus and Arène, and Aridisols and Entisols. 
These illustrate that soils can form with minimal interaction with life. 
Chemical weathering involves the chemical alteration of parent material (rock) in contact with water, that causes dissolution and chemical transformation of minerals e.g. via hydrolysis, and the chemical leaching of the parent material (removal and enrichment of certain elements). 
Primary mineral constituents are altered to other minerals (clay minerals, hydroxides, sulfates, silica). The process removes elements from the soil (sodium, potassium, calcium) but enriches it in others (aluminium, iron, silica). Feldspar and mica alter to clay minerals and aluminium hydroxis. 
We end up with a fine gained material that often has distinct soil horizons, where weathering and leaching decreases towards bedrock. 
This cannot happen on e.g. The moon and most asteroids, as they lack water required for chemical weathering. That is why the unconsilodated material covering them is just broken up rock, not mineralogically altered. It's appropriate to call it regolith.

I honestly had no idea that soil could form without life. But when I think about it, the difference between soil and regolith is the presence of organic material and compounds. I guess my question is this; how do we define “organic” material? Is it any compound with (un)saturated carbon bonds? Or is it more complicated than that; requiring organic compounds that could only have been derived by life? For example, could humic or fulvic acids form abiotically? And if so, would a regolith with abiotically derived humic substances be categorized as soil??

yqrs27,https://www.reddit.com/user/Bbrhuft,8,"Well Friedrich Wöhler first created an organic molecule, Urea, in 1828 using bench top inorganic chemistry. Since then science understood that organic molecules don't need life to form.

Organic molecules are molecules that are made of carbon and hydrogen, and can include other elements. Organic molecules must contain carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen atoms (C-H bonds). They usually involve oxygen and can also contain nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous, and others.

On the early Earth, before life, photochemical reactions, Fischer–Tropsch process, fluid mineral interactions generated organic molecules. Indeed, you can find abundant organics (0.1% to 5%) in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. I own a fragment of Aguas Zarcas, a carbonaceous chondrite. It smells like bituminous limestone, I can smell its organics. 
Importantly, before there was life on Earth, it is thought that organics accumulated because there was nothing to eat them, forming a rich primordial soup, that formed a warm little pond:

My dear Hooker,
... It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present, which could ever have been present.
But if (and oh what a big if) we could conceive in some warm little pond with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, - light, heat, electricity &c. present, that a protein compound was chemically formed, ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter wd be instantly devoured, or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed.

Atmospheric Lightning, demonstrated by the famous Miller-Urey experiment, is also thought to have played a role, though it is now thought to have also demonstrated, as well, the importance of water-rock interactions (the flask itself also took part in the reactions, the borosilicate glass partly dissolved and contributed to the reaction which recapitulated the water-rock interaction on early Earth, of weathering/erosion and pedogenisis):

Yes, it is likely that soils on the early Earth accumulated a lot of abiotic organics, that rained out of the atmosphere and/or were generated in soils themselves. I think these organic molecules likely took part in mineral-water chemical reactions and mineral weathering, in pedogenesis. That said, weathering was also accelerated by acid rain, due to high concentrations of CO2 and SO2 (from volcanic activity).
There is also some interesting research on the mineral Fougèrite (green rust), that presently forms in water saturated anoxic soils, Gleysols. Researchers think it may have played an important role in the development of life in the early Archean ocean (and possibly on land) via the concentration pre-biotic organic molecules and catalysis of organic chemical reactions (via metal-organic catalysis; ""Green rust; poor man's palladium"").
The study of Fougèrite came out from earlier research that investigated its utility in cleaning up soil contamination. It has the remarkable ability to trap heavy metals and toxic organic molecules in its nanocrystal structure, that get trapped inside electrically charged molecular sheets.
TLDR: Soils likely existed on Earth from the time it had running water, and these were soil sensu stricto containing a rich soup of organic compounds.

Then it's not soil, it's called regolith. The term soil implicitly requires life

I think you're being unnecessarily pedantic, soil is a very general term that can refer to a lot of things depending on what industry you're working in. In geotechnical engineering/soil mechanics, soil is any mixture of mineral solids, air, and commonly water (but not always) and rarely requires life. If we're taking samples 200 ft down of material weathered in place from parent bedrock, it was weathered by chemical means not by life, and we refer to it as residual soil, no one would call it regolith.

Hence, we propose that soil is a centimetric or thicker unconsolidated layer of fine-grained mineral and/or organic material, with or without coarse elements and cemented portions, lying at or near the surface of planets, moons, and asteroids, which shows clear evidence of chemical weathering.

By soil, they mean chemically weathered regolith (soil being a subcategory of regolith).
I think this inconsistency stems from the fact that soil science develops to serve farming, the growing of crops, so the first soil scientists looked at soil from the top down. However, if you were like me and started studying soils and palaeosols from the bottom up, from their origin via chemical weathering of rock and generations of saprolite is magnified, I can completely forget that soils involve life, indeed, they often do not requite life to form.

basically cyanobacteria were the first organisms to use photosynthesis, which has oxygen as a waste product.  And nothing used the oxygen.  The photosynthesis essentially allowed the organism to harvest energy from nothing, which is far better than absorbing nearby molecules.. so they grew in leaps and bounds.
The huge rush of oxygen drastically changed the planet (it cause it to freeze over...) and the presence of the oxygen (a toxic byproduct!) and the changing temperatures actually limited the growth of cyanobacteria.
Only once this product was plentiful and easy to access was any traits that used oxygen actually a good fit to the environment, and oxygen using organisms started to show up.  Prior to the event any organisms with an oxygen using trait would either have gone unused, or died off (due to poorly managed resources at minimum)

I was told they planted Australian ironwoods, which apparently are very tolerant of water that has some salt in it. This is important since the entire island is so flat and low, that if you dig down anywhere in it, the hole will fill with sea-water, though the sand somehow filters some of the salt away.
After a few years of these trees shedding material (needles/leaves?), plus the Navy fertilizing with whatever it needed, a thin rudimentary soil was built up enough that various other plants were introduced, some of which survived, adding a small amount of diversity. 
Some sailor along the way released some yellow parakeets, and now there is a flock of them they bunch together, eating insects. There are also beautiful small white Terns, and I don't know how they were introduced. The Gooney birds are the size of a goose, and during half the year they nest and raise young, covering the island with bird manure, processed mostly from eating squid. Dead birds also add to the bio-diversity of the soil.

But I would like to add that microbes play a central role here as well. Both in the initial colonization of land and secondary succession, microbes provide a substrate for multicellular organisms to grip onto and acquire nutrients from inorganic sources.  The common ancestor of plants used symbiosis with fungi, so it is likely that the first plant used microbes to help itself grow.
Bacteria help stuff stick. They typically live in communities called biofilms that allow them to adhere to hard and flat surfaces. Examples are the grime on your teeth if you don't brush, or the slime that forms on a boat sitting in the water too long. The biofilms on boats have been shown to then allow multicellular organisms to stick, like sea weeds, barnacles and zooplankton. Biofilms also help with moisture retention, keeping water around longer to prevent drying out.
Microbes are really good at finding nutrients. They have specialized ways of getting them into organic forms available to more complex life forms.  Some bacteria use specialized chemical reactions to ""fix"" important nutrients, like taking inert molecular nitrogen from the air and making organic forms like amino acids. Microbes can also extract nutrients from rock, in a process called leeching. This provides nutrients but also aids in erosion to help create soil particles.
The stickiness and nutrient acquisition of microbes is probably why the first plants formed symbiotic relationships with fungi. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534715001366 Most soil IS a biofilm where microbes are constantly fixing and leeching nutrients and eroding the earth to build more soil. Add an energy source like photosynthesis and you supercharge the process. Plants and microbes have been working together ever since.

But when we factor in the colonization of land by microbial biomats that can bind sediments together and slow erosion, then soil can form as a symbiosis of the mineral and biological communities.

Indeed, there a many examples of Archean paleosols, the oldest 3.7 billion years old. 
Igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rock, containing feldspar, mica ferromagnesian minerals and quartz slowly weather via hydrolysis (they basically, slowly react with water). Another factor to consider is the atmosphere was likely highly acidic due to much higher CO2 levels and acid rain from volcanic eruptions. The early stages of chemical weathering generate clay minerals along fractures and cleavage planes of minerals e.g. biotite mica, this causes expansion of minerals and mechanical breakdown of the rock, further accelerating the weathering process. 
Chemical weathering will, over hundreds to thousands of years, generate thick chemically weathered soils many metres deep. Today, chemically weathered soils are influenced by oxygen, generating Terra Rossa, laterites and bauxites, but I think most likely the soil formed before the life moved on land , would have been similar to a Gley Soil. 
Gley soil is a waterlogged anoxic clayey to sandy soil typically found in low lying areas, lacusterine and deltaic environments. It often contains the interesting clay mineral, Fougèrite, studied for its ability to sequester toxic substances (heavy metals and molecules), it may have played a role in the origin of life (by concentrating organic molecules).

I recommend you go online and Google “ecological succession”. It’s something commonly found and discussed in Life Science textbooks, particularly in the 6th-8th grade. It’s the process that describes phenomena such as how a volcanic eruption building an island can turn bare sea into a jungle over a few thousand years.

It is possible for a plant to grow in a liquid medium with a sandy substrate like the ocean, and it is also possible for plants to grow in a liquid medium without any substrate at all, such as with hydrophonics. Moreover soil also contains organic compounds found in animals, such that dead animals on their own will become a substrate once completely decomposed. The body farm is a good example of this - some of the most decomposed cadavers appear to be little more than bones and something which could be described as a moist substrate.

Soils dont come from dead plants, they come from eroded rock. Some soils do have organic matter, but they mostly just minerals and rocks.
After millions of years of erosion, rocks get broken down and their minerals are released. The rocks get broken down into sand, silt and clay. 
Sand are particles that are visible to the naked eye and are easy to count. These are generaly very tiny rocks.Sand rarely froms any structure.
Silt are particles that are hard to see with the naked eye when looking at a single particle. Soils with high silt content dont absorb a lot of water, so they dont form pools of water.
Clay are the smallest particle, imposible to see a single particle with the naked eye. Clay forms many structures, it can form square blocks, rectangular blocks, wedges, and many more. Clay particles can hold water inside them, thats why soils with high clay content form pools of water. 
All soils are made from these 3 particles, and some some soils contains the 3 particles and some organic matter.

Some plants and life forms can survive in soils lacking dead organic residuals.  Some actually thrive in those conditions, and are important in creating more livable soils for the later plants which do require better nutrient distribution and availability (and porosity).  Basically, starter species are the first inhabitants, and by living and dying there, improve the soils for later arrivals (which could not survive under the initial conditions).  There is a succession of life forms as the soil evolves.

Evidence of the emergence of embryophyte land plants first occurs in the mid-Ordovician (~470 million years ago), and by the middle of the Devonian (~390 million years ago), many of the features recognised in land plants today were present, including roots and leaves. By Late Devonian (~370 million years ago) some free-sporing plants such as Archaeopteris had secondary vascular tissue that produced wood and had formed forests of tall trees.

yc89rq,https://www.reddit.com/user/safedeprescribing,331,"Thanks for your question dij
The umbrella paper didn't examine the causes of depression - it evaluated just the support for the serotonin hypothesis of depression. We outline it in more general terms here: https://theconversation.com/depression-is-probably-not-caused-by-a-chemical-imbalance-in-the-brain-new-study-186672
One thing that came up a lot in the studies was the strong relationship of stressful life events to risk of depression.
As for SSRIs, this is an interesting topic - as there is a lot of debate about their short term impact. A few relevant issues: in studies of antidepressants versus placebo, everyone in the study has quite a large improvement in depression scores (this is how depression is measured in these studies) so everyone experiences quite an impact whether they are given sugar tablets or antidepressants. The difference in the effect of antidepressants compared to placebo (sugar tablets) is small. For some context: placebo reduces depression scores (of the 52 point Hamilton depression score rating scale) by 8 points over 6-8 weeks, and antidepressants do so by 9.8 points over 6-8 weeks. The difference is 1.8 points on this 52 point scale (about 1/4 the size of the placebo effect) and many people think that this does not count as a 'clinically important difference'. (I.e. it is statistically significant, but the size of the difference is not enough to make a difference to someone - a bit like a diet pill that beats placebo statistically but only produces 50 grams of weight loss). 
So a large portion of the antidepressant effect is placebo - which is really all about hope and expectation. 
Another hypothesis about why people report such a positive effect from antidepressants is because they might numb your emotions - ie. turn down the volume on both positive and negative emotions (this might also relate to the numbing effects they have physically e.g. on genital tissue) which might be a great relief for someone in the middle of turmoil. 
There are lots of other scientific hypotheses for how antidepressants might work - but none are currently proven but they are often discussed. Will address them below to specific questions.

yc89rq,https://www.reddit.com/user/safedeprescribing,121,"Hey RTS, good questions. 
I think the first thing to say is that there has been very little research about the long term effects of antidepressant use on the brain - indeed pretty close to zero. A lot of research in the field is sponsored by drug companies and these focus on studies that show the drugs in a positive light so there has been little effort to look at the long term effects of the drugs, especially the potentially damaging effects of the drugs on the brain. so we only know a few things.
1) the brain is a plastic organ and adapts to changes in the neurochemical environment. Humans operate under the principle of homeostasis - ie we try to keep things 'in the middle'. If it is too hot outside, our bodies cool down - and vice versa. In response to the abnormally high levels of serotonin that most commonly used antidepressants generate the brain will become less sensitive to serotonin - ie. down-regulate serotonin receptors etc. This has been shown to occur in neuroimaging of people who are taking antidepressants and some studies show that these sort of changes can last months or years after stopping the drug. 
There are presumably a number of other changes that happen downstream of serotonin receptors but these have not been studied. there are also studies showing that there are greater reductions in the brain volume of people who are depressed who take antidepressants than those who are depressed but don't take antidepressants. 
Antidepressants cause concentration difficulties, sleep disruption and memory impairments in the short term and in the long term there is some observational evidence that they increase the risk of dementia (especially cholinergic ones) and it is not clear if these effects and changes relate to the neurobiological changes outlined above.

there are a lot of serotonergic neurons in the gut so antidepressants will affect these and not just those in the brain. This is why people think that antidepressants cause gut adverse effects (sometimes called 'side effect'). I am sorry I don't know the details of how the gut is affected specifically by antidepressants, just that anorexia, weight gain, diarrhoea, constipation and nausea are common effects of antidepressants (some of which might be via a gut mechanism - but may also be hormonal or central). 
I am not spruiking any new compound! I have contributed to designing and setting up a clinic which helps people to safely stop antidepressants by a gradual, supported tapering process based on the neurobiology of the drugs which there is evidence helps people to stop their drugs with less withdrawal symptoms than old-fashioned methods. There are no new drugs or compounds involved!

yc89rq,https://www.reddit.com/user/safedeprescribing,124,"I think all the evidence points to depression being a perfectly natural reaction to oppressive circumstances. Study after study shows incredibly strong relationships between how many stressful life events someone experiences - relationship breakdown, job loss, physical illness, etc - and their chance of developing depression in the following months. Low wages and poor living conditions are chronic stressors that also clearly influence risk of depression. 
Neuroticism - how sensitive you are to stress - also seems to play some role in risk of depression (and this may be where early life experiences or genetics come in to play). 
Depression is best conceptualised as a mammalian response to overwhelming stress or threat - it occurs in dogs exposed to inescapable shock, to monkeys removed from their troop, etc. It is a common response to environmental stress.
As for your proposition I think once you understand the above you might see that societal interventions like addressing poverty, unemployment, poor living conditions would be the most sensible response to depression - addressing the causes rather than papering over the problems with drugs that might numb or provide hope through the placebo effect or in some cases produce a short lived euphoria. I think it is becoming clearer that overall the drugs are not producing overall positive effects - they cause all sorts of negative physical effects, numb emotions, impair cognition, can undermine people's abilities to cope with adversity so I do not think they are a life boat. 
At the same time I am not sure that therapy is always the best answer - although it can be helpful. If the main problem is financial insecurity then no amount of therapy will help that. But therapy can help people understand how they have ended up in certain circumstances or patterns and work on strategies. 
But as implied in your question we really should understand depression as an understandable response to social adversity so we can be more clear about the solutions - addressing social adversity. We become confused when we consider it a medical disorder relating to an individual or their brain chemistry for which drugs or other biological treatments are the answer.

Post SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) is attracting more attention from the medical community. It seems to occur to a proportion of people who stop antidepressants where the sexual problems experienced on the drug do not go away when the drug is stopped. This seems to indicate persistent changes to the brain or genitals that last for months and sometimes years after stopping. More research is needed to work out what is going on - it is not clear if it is a hormonal effect, a central nervous system effect, or a peripheral nerve effect. I know there are various hypotheses out there. 
It is not my area of specialty but my general reading suggests that there are no proven drugs that help although many are trialled and that most people recover over time, although this takes far longer than many expect. It sounds like an awful condition and people considering starting antidepressants should be made aware this is a potential consequence of doing so. It is not known what proportion of patients this occurs to - which really needs to be looked into as it is such a devastating outcome.

yc89rq,https://www.reddit.com/user/safedeprescribing,85,"This is one of the most prominent theories for how antidepressants may affect the brain - by growing new neurons. And actually I did my PhD in a lab looking specifically at this hypothesis and part of my PhD was on this topic. 
In fact, it was learning about hippocampal neurogenesis that got me so excited about this field and led to me pursuing a PhD in how antidepressants work.
But I think there is alternative way of looking at this that is not often discussed. Strokes, chemical insults to the brain and electrical currents also cause neurogenesis in the brain. That is, the brain responds to toxic insults by a repair mechanism that involves the growth of new brain cells. 
Ketamine for instance is widely recognised to be neurotoxic (cause damage to the brain) in animal models.
I am currently working with some colleagues on a paper in which rodents were given an antidepressant at the rodent-equivalent dose to the human dose and half of them had seizures. Because of the lab rules these animals had to be sacrificed and were not allowed to be further examined. But the remaining animals had extremely high levels of neurogenesis. So perhaps the toxicity of the drug caused seizures and neurogenesis, suggesting that neurogenesis might not be evidence of a helpful effects.  
So it may be that neurogenesis in the brain in response to different chemicals is not a sign that they are helpful but that they are causing toxicity which leads to a protective response to compensate. This would be consistent with the long term effects discussed above - e.g. long lasting post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, protracted withdrawal syndromes, and the cognitive impairments caused by antidepressants (and some evidence of increased risk of dementia in long-term users).

yc89rq,https://www.reddit.com/user/safedeprescribing,107,"Hey bwaX
I'll give a brief answer here because I can see the questions are piling up. 
Analyses of the genetic component of depression puts it as 37%. This is much lower than things like height which are 80%+.
These studies have also been criticised for attributing more to genetics than to the environment by under-estimating the role of shared environments. The work of Jay Joseph has focused on this. 
But even if we accept this 37% as correct - it means that the vast majority of the cause of depression is environmental. 
Depression seems to be best understood as the reaction of mammals to adversity/stress/lack of met needs. I am sure that there are genetic variation in how susceptible people are to this state but I think it is not the most useful approach to understanding depression - you can't change people's genetics. Whereas we know there are lots of things you can do to create security, meet needs etc that help depression - so to me the keys are in focusing on the environmental and psychological factors.
To underline this there was a huge study looking at all the genetic variants that have been thought to cause depression. Every single one came up with no effect. Even though the study was not aiming to look at this what came up very strongly was: stressful life events. 
The idea that a specific genetic variant could be causing depression is so far coming up empty: https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18070881

yc89rq,https://www.reddit.com/user/safedeprescribing,285,"I explain it more here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSjYH044-2Q&t=359s
But briefly:
We recommend that safely stopping antidepressants normally takes months or longer (sometimes more or much more than a year) especially in long term users. Tapering more slowly reduces the intensity of withdrawal symptoms and gives time for the brain to adapt to the lower levels of the drug. 
We also recommend going at a pace that the patient can tolerate - rather than just issuing a set of dose reductions which can often backfire. Some people can tolerate quicker reductions, others cannot - we are still working on the what determines this - but the best approach is to titrate rate of reduction to what the person can tolerate. 
The hyperbolic part: the relationship between dose of drug and its effect on the brain (e.g inhibition of the serotonin transporter but also other receptor targets) is hyperbolic. Hard to explain this without a picture but basically the effect on the brain goes up very steeply for small doses and then plateaus at the doses normally used in clinical practice. 
You can see the pictures here in a free link to the paper: https://markhorowitz.org/academic-paper/tapering-of-ssri-treatment-to-mitigate-withdrawal-symptoms/
What this means is that if you reduce the drug by linear amounts e.g. 20mg, 15mg, 10mg, 5mg, 0mg as is often done in clinical practice the effect on the brain becomes larger and larger each time. I'll give an example for citalopram one of the most commonly used antidepressants:
20 to 15mg dose reduction: 3% reduction in effect on the brain
15 to 10mg dose reduction: 6% reduction in effect on the brain
10mg to 5mg dose reduction: 13% reduction in effect on the brain
5mg to 0mg dose reduction: 58% reduction in effect on the brain
I/e the perturbation or change to the brain gets hyperbolically larger the more you go down. 
So the way to taper is to reduce dose hyperbolically - which means you make smaller and smaller dose reductions so that the change in effect on the brain remains constant.
So keeping with the citalopram example:
Reducing from 20mg to 5.4mg : 20% reduction in effect on the brain
Reducing from 5.4mg to 2.3mg : 20% reduction in effect on the brain
Reducing from 2.3mg to 0.8mg : 20% reduction in effect on the brain
Reducing from 0.8mg to 0mg: 20% reduction in effect on the brain
This pattern of dose reduction is called hyperbolic tapering because it follows the hyperbolic pattern of the drugs. 
Now many people will find these 4 dose jumps too large so you can insert intermediate steps in between them also following a hyperbolic pattern 
And you can work out what rate of reduction someone can tolerate by following this pattern, 
Lastly, people often need support during this process because it can be unpleasant as the neurobiological changes cause emotional and physical withdrawal symptoms so it is good to have some sort of support during the process. 
Sorry for a long answer that I said would be brief!

On the other hand the harms of antidepressants are very common:
-half of people get sexual problems from it, an unknown proportion will have these persist for months or years after stopping
-half of people experience emotional numbing
-there appears to be an increased risk of diabetes, weight gain , cardiovascular disease, strokes, falls, fractures and early death from long term use of antidepressants
-other adverse effects include sleep impairment, concentration problems, etc
This paper aimed to quantify adverse effects in short term randomised controlled trials of antidepressants and to compare the to benefits and concluded ""SSRIs might have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but all trials were at high risk of bias and the clinical significance seems questionable. SSRIs significantly increase the risk of both serious and non-serious adverse events. The potential small beneficial effects seem to be outweighed by harmful effects.""

Most people who use benzodiazepines are not addicted to them (although some are). the vast majority who use the drugs as recommended by their doctors develop what is called 'physical dependence' which is where the body adapts to the drug and so when you stop it you get withdrawal effects. 
And yes the same approach to coming off antidepressants also applies to coming off benzodiazepines (or really any psychiatric drug that causes withdrawal effects) . 
More gradual tapering minimises the risk of withdrawl effects. And the relationship between dose of benzo and effect on the brain is also hyperbolic and so tapering gradually and hyperbolically (and with support and individualised to the person so that it is tolerable) is the best way to come off benzodiazepines too. 
At the moment people use the Ashton Manual to come off benzos which loosely follows these principles (but is sometimes too fast) but it offers some structure for doing so.

yc89rq,https://www.reddit.com/user/safedeprescribing,37,"Hey napsack, 
Good question!
There are several reasons why a doctor would recommend this in the first place which I will summarise briefly:
-the drug was never effective (recent studies have estimated that 15% of people given antidepressants benefit from them in the short term - and there is evidence that even less do well in the long term)
-the drug was originally effective but the effect has worn off - most psychoactive drugs wear off over time - this is called tolerance, sometimes colourfully called 'poop out' in the US - and so they may no longer be doing anything beneficial
-the drug has been used beyond guidelines. Most antidepressants are recommended to be used for 6-12 months, and only using them for longer when there are serious risk factors. But we know many people are on these drugs for many years and some for decades
-adverse effects outweigh benefits. There are many adverse effects some mentioned above including sexual side effects, cognitive problems, emotional numbing, weight gain which each affect about 1 in 4 or 1 in 2 patients on antidepressants. There are also long term potential physical health effects - antidepressants have been found to increase risk of the following in large-scale observational studies: weight gain, diabetes, stroke, falls, cardiovascular disease, bleeding, low blood sodium, premature death, and for some drugs dementia. They also increase the risk of foetal abnormalities in pregnant mothers (although the absolute risk remains low antidepressants are thought to double or triple various foetal abnormalities)  
-patient choice - people want to stop them
-and the drugs may worsen the outcomes of the conditions they are meant to treat according to some analyses
-lastly, people are often kept on drugs to prevent future relapse of their condition. But the research that finds that the drugs prevent relapse has recently been called into question because withdrawal effects from antidepressants may have been mistaken for relapse and so it is not clear whether antidepressants do prevent relapse - they may just be preventing withdrawal effects from antidepressants
-the longer you stay on antidepressants the harder it is to stop them because your risk of withdrawal effects increases with time

I’m interested in how distinct the various classes of antidepressants are, or whether there is a degree of arbitrariness in classifying something as an SSRI vs a SNRI for example. How useful and meaningful is the separating them into categories of MAOI, SSRI, SNRI, TCA (and any others!)? Is there overlap between their mechanism of actions? Is there evidence of different classes being useful with regards to different specific symptoms?
I’m a fan of linguistics and I’ve always been curious about how the naming of drugs (broadly, such as ‘antidepressant’ or ‘serotonin reuptake inhibitor’ or ‘antimalarial’; as opposed to a specific chemical name) influences our use of it and beliefs around it. Since I’m imagining all drugs have multiple, maybe countless effects that we have varying degrees of insight into. Why name it after just one of those effects?! Could popularly naming SSRI’s as such have contributing to the enduring belief of ‘serotonin deficiency’ as the root of depression, do you think? I’d love any of your thoughts or anecdotes on this. 
Are there any other areas in your field where you notice that the commonly-held beliefs or most popular practices don’t necessarily align with how the brain works or how psychiatric medications function?

Briefly: the definition of 'Major depressive disorder' was defined by consensus by committee of psychiatrists. Many people on these committees were funded by drug companies. The transformation of states of hopelessness, despair, demoralisation, grief, loneliness into a medical condition called 'depression' has been executed incredibly well over the last few decades. This has been to the advantage of drug companies selling medication for these conditions. 

In studies following people for 30 years 86% of people will meet the criteria for an anxiety or depressive disorder meaning that it is completely normal to feel like this. We get depressed when overwhelmed and we get anxious when we are faced with threats. 
We have been convinced this is a brain illness requiring drugs by a large industry. Words like demoralisation, grief etc are much more informative because they tell us about the cause of the problem and that directs us what to do to help solve it.

I agree that it is very difficult to get independent data in medical sciences because of the massive conflicts of interest in who runs the studies. This is particularly true for AD research.

But I now think that this is a mostly misguided way to study depression. We become depressed when we are overwhelmed and our needs are not met. The most important study comes from understanding how best to address these problems. This involves politics and social theory and psychology, etc. 
Of course the brain is involved in depression in a truistic sense but I don't think depression is a 'brain illness' that requires us to understand the brain to help people. 
Mostly this makes me think of someone talking to a friend who says they feel hopeless and despairing since their partner died. It would take a particular sort of person to say 'I need to study your brain to understand what is really going on in this depression of yours. What are the neurochemical causes of it? When I work that out I will be able to truly get to the root of what is wrong.'  
Or another example - when we learn a new language, say Japanese, certainly our brain changes - the electricity and chemistry will be modified in some way. But if a student of japanese said they were going to stop attending japanese class but instead start studying the brains of people who know Japanese to work out the exact pattern of electrical and chemical changes that underlie this state, you would be pretty sure they were heading in the wrong direction. 
I think the same is true in the study of depression - we are mistaking a software problem for a hardware problem. When Word crashes we don't open up the hard disk to try to understand what has gone wrong with the circuits, we need to address the program. When it comes to depression the most useful answers I think are in relationships, material and emotional security, etc. But the current neuro-mania at the moment I am sure will mean there is a lot more study of the amygdala, hippocampal neurogenesis, genetics and inflammation...

I have outlined the adverse effects for antidepressants in general above which will apply to sertraline. Common effects include weight gain, emotional numbing, memory and concentration impairment, daytime fatigue, sleep disruption, sexual problems. Some people have agitation or worsened mood. In the long term there seems to be an increased risk of weight gain, diabetes, stroke, falls, fractures, bleeding and increased risk of premature mortality. 
I don't know the specific relationship between serotonin and feeling tired. But I do know that this is a very common adverse effect of SSRIs like sertraline. It may be that these drugs induce fatigue directly but it also may be that the daytime fatigue, tiredness is caused by the sleep architecture disruption caused by antidepressants. SSRIs clearly disrupt normal sleep structures and this is why they probably have an effect on dreaming (decreased or absent) and may explain why there is memory and concentration impairments and also day time tiredness. 
Yes it is. Although the details are not understood precisely - the longer you are on an antidepressants the more likely you are to have withdrawal effects when you reduce or stop it and so the more slowly you need to to go when coming off. We are just about to publish a 'risk calculator' that puts in risk factors and give a preliminary suggestion for how quick or slow to taper.

yc89rq,https://www.reddit.com/user/Henri_Dupont,2,"Many of the people I know with the worst mental health outcomes had these adverse experiences because they quit taking their medicines. Bipolar patients in particular, throw away their meds when they feel great, then go into dangerous manic phases. They spend money, take wild risks, gamble away their savings, drive off their friends and family, and eventually crash into suicidal depression. This was the story of my life until I learned what medicines work for me. 
It is really important for these people to keep taking their meds, not taper off them. I expect you're going to tell us it's because they didn't taper off them slowly. I am quite skeptical. Bipolar disease is a chronic condition, it doesn't go away, rather it gets worse over time if unchecked. Bipolar disease is deadly and often ends in suicide. There are too many messages in our society already telling people not to ""take pills"" or ""rely on a crutch"". it's my assertion that these patients need to be on meds permanently. 
Do you use this tapering protocol on bipolar patients? Have you followed them long term to determine if they relapse?  Do you have a reasoned response to my assertion that many bipolar patients should never quit using their meds? Is there a protocol to determine which patients may benefit and which ones will not from tapering off psych drugs?

Picture your body as a rain barrel. Whenever you eat an offending food, your body reacts & adds water to the barrel. Whether you notice the reaction or not, the reaction is happening. Your body is releasing eosinophils & histamine to counteract what you just ate. Overtime, your rain barrel is filling up according to your diet. Then one day....BOOM! A full blown allergic reaction occurs because your barrel finally overflowed. The problem is you never know when that day will come. Will it be 10 years from now, or will it be today? You never know. Protect yourself. Don't eat offending foods, wear a medical alert bracelet, and always carry an EpiPen. Be safe! 😊

My allergy doctor told me that most food allergy sufferers will either hate or crave the food they're allergic to. Fortunately, that gives the allergist a good starting point as to what foods should be tested for first. Good luck. 😊

We have multiple levels of immunity and defenses from pathogens. An allergic reaction a specific pathway of immunity with its own cell lines. It is distinct from the immunity pathway that would be used for bacteria or viruses. So if you lacked the pathway responsible for allergic reactions, it wouldn’t do anything for those pathogens. But the allergic pathway is helpful to prevent and attack parasites. Multicellular organisms can’t be attacked by our immune system in the same way as a virus or bacteria. An allergic reaction is essentially our body thinking we have a parasite, when in reality the antigen is benign. So if you took some medications that stop you from having allergies, you could be more vulnerable to parasites. Of course it’s not that drastic of a difference in clinical practice and people in developed countries have higher morbidity and mortality from allergies than from parasites. But this is one reason why people think allergies have been so much worse in the modern era. We no longer have the parasites infecting us and training our immune system to properly target them, so our system becomes hyper aware of things it wouldn’t normally be bothered with.

I think your takeaway here is a bit sideways. In this case, some parasites secrete a protein that suppress our immune response.

So by infecting yourself with one of those pathogens, you would have chronically high IgE and eosinophilia which are the same findings as someone with allergic rhinitis for example. If anything, you would be priming your immune system to respond more quickly. But our bodies are actually smarter than just overproducing cell lines that only fight one category of infection while neglecting the other pathogen fighting categories. The reactions are more local. That way you won't die from a viral respiratory infection while already fighting a staph infection in your skin. Both infections require completely different cell lines that inhibit the production of each other. With chronic disease or severe illness you can see a systemic shift of cell lines that can make you vulnerable to other pathogens, but that's after the local control has been outpaced and requires more resources to fight.

I was a heroin addict for 11 or so years. In some corners of the world people believe that histamines have anti-aging properties. Opiate uses stimulates histamine. Heroin is also believed to ""de-age"" someone once they get clean.
I started opiate use at 25/26 and stopped it at 36. I was a high functioning addict that never missed a meal, never stole, never lived on the streets. Prior to my addiction I had a skincare routine that became not so routine during my addiction. In recovery skincare has become an obsession of sorts.
People constantly tell me how I look much younger for my age. People who knew me prior to my addiction, didn't see me for a decade, and saw me again make comments on how I didn't age a day with some saying I look younger than 10 years prior. 
I have attached a censored photo for reference that I will absolutely delete.
Could histamines play a role in most heroin addicts not aging similar to their alcohol, cocaine, meth counterparts?

yrbd3f,https://www.reddit.com/user/lavachat,2,"If you're a drippy nose because of hay fever - yes, take them regularly during the whole allergy season. If it's combined with asthma or a pet allergy - no, take them as soon as the first symptoms appear and concentrate on avoiding the allergens as much as possible. Plus take different meds.
Pollen or house mite allergies etc. are immune reactions to complex, structurally big and diverse antigens - just the thing to be confused with a complex, multicellular parasite. So those reactions use primarily the histaminic pathway, which can be depleted through anti-histamines.
Pet allergies are mostly due to one or a few proteins from the salivary or skin glands, so elicit a far broader response over multiple pathways and immune cell lines, they are more similar to bacteria vor viruses than to parasites. Antihistamines don't suppress most of the other responses, and can probably even upregulate other cytokines when tissues get used to regular antihistamine doses. So the next reaction might be more severe. Asthma or even allergic asthma isn't specific enough, for some responses antihistamines help, for some they don't. 
Asthma and pet allergy variants can get worse with exposure, so avoiding exposure is really important if you're not very sure you have the safer kind. When taking anti-histamins, you mask a few symptoms and get a false sense of security - ""Oh, I took my meds, if I don't avoid the antigen I'll still be fine, it's not too bad"" - boom, anaphylaxis.

yrbd3f,https://www.reddit.com/user/AlphaBetaGammaDonut,42,"'Immune system sees something alien, and responds to it' is the extremely simplified version of the story. 
The very simplified version is that there are 5 types of antibodies, and they each set off different immune responses, with different symptoms.
Vaccines and infections usually involve the antibody we call IgG, and the response is fever/soreness, the stuff we usually think of as an Immune reaction.
Allergy is driven by the IgE antibody, and it sets off different immune cells and the symptoms are rashes/running eyes and nose/swelling.
In terms of comfort, a mild IgG response is much better - it's often barely noticeable. Immunotherapy tries to convert the IgE response to IgG, the hope being that a 'severe reaction' will be a mild fever and some tiredness instead of, say, the patient's throat closing.
This is the very simplified version of the story. The nuanced version is still incomplete, and is a mess of highly interconnected processing involving dozens of cells and proteins with names like Th1, IL17a and CD23 (which is also known as FCeRII, where the e is an epsilon symbol!). Honestly, the immune system is a mess.

The allergic reaction that is deadly happens when the body gets confused and greatly overestimates the threat, causing it to go into panic mode and launch a full on, over the top assault against the foreign invader.
Imagine your body is like a city. The sting is like a hostage taker holed up inside a building. The appropriate response is to send in the SWAT team, take out the hostage taker and you’re good. Might break a few windows or a door in the building, but it’s not a huge deal overall.
When you have a bad allergic reaction, it’s because someone high up making the calls on how to respond gets confused and thinks that, instead of a single hostage taker, it’s the start of a zombie outbreak and there’s a risk of the entire city being overrun and destroyed if imminent drastic action isn’t taken, so they start a massive, indiscriminate firebombing campaign that will do a ton of damage and may even destroy the city, but it’s the only chance at stopping the zombie outbreak that definitely would destroy the city.
Only, again, there are no zombies. It’s just a single hostage taker in a single building that would never be able to cause anywhere near the level of death and destruction that the firebombing is doing.

The main ""young"" thing is that the very first treatment for peanut allergies has finally been FDA approved, specifically for 4-17 year olds, implying reasonable safety and effectiveness.  They probably targeted that age range because peanut allergies are much more dangerous for kids than adults (who can be more careful, identify the symptoms, and self-treat quickly).
I'd be willing to bet it'll expand in time, it just takes a lot of time and money to get approval.

After you get tested, they start you off with a multi-week period called ""cluster shots"" where you sit in a waiting room and get 4 shots over 4 hours.  They observe your reactions and adjust the particle count accordingly.
They then taper off the cluster shots into once per month, then it's just one shot per month.  Each shot, they increase the dosage.  At some point, you max out on the FDA's numbers.
For some people, it's enough over a few years, and they can either stop and be mostly allergy-free, or they get a drop under the tongue.

Type 1 immunity is for “foreign” things.
Type 2 immunity is monitoring of “self”. Interestingly, the more active the type 1 immunity is, there is inhibition of parts of type 2. I believe it’s been shown that People with more well-developed type 1 immunity have lower rates of type 2 problems (like auto-immune diseases).  
A vaccine stimulates your immune systems ability to create a “memory” of an antigen, and is like showing a photo of a criminal to some people watching CCTV cameras monitoring your home. Your immune system uses T cells and B cells to file away information about the foreign substance (tape the picture to the wall, save on a hard drive, etc). How that gets delivered, and for how long the info is saved, is why vaccines are different. Also, not all germs (virus, bacteria, politicians) can be identified by a photo on CCTV, maybe for some they wear a certain kind of boot, a specific jacket, or have a certain hairstyle.
An allergen is like if the photo was of your doppelgänger, and the response by security is graded. If it’s just a stop and frisk, you can get around it with your ID (think antihistamine or over the counter meds). Or they can pepper spray you (you get hives, itching, etc).
If it’s anaphylaxis, then security was told to be on high alert for a violent criminal with dangerous weapons. When they saw you, They called the swat team. You need something NOW or you’re dead (aka epi-pen).

When you have allergies, your body produces IgE antibodies against the allergen. These IgE antibodies then trigger mast cells which release histamines and trigger the allergic reaction. 
As opposed to a vaccine, where you are teaching your body to make IgG antibodies against an antigen (foreign invader). These antibodies mark the antigen for destruction by the immune system. 
When you take allergy shots, you're actually getting a vaccine. It's teaching your body to make IgG antibodies against the allergen (pretending like it's an antigen). When IgG antibodies bind, they instead a) mark the allergen for destruction b) prevent IgE antibodies from binding. Both of these prevent the allergic reaction from occuring. 
The desensitizing/acclimating explanation is technically misleading, because you're just training a different (more serious?) immune response instead. 
Obviously this is a very very simplified explanation, but if I'm wrong about any portion of this, I would love to be corrected

yrbd3f,https://www.reddit.com/user/brodneys,18,"That's exactly how allergies work: frequently (although not always) the human body doesn't react to something the first time it's exposed, but develops a reaction the second or 15th time because your body has since identified it as a threat.  When you develop an allergy you haven't previously had, it's usually because your immune system is treating it exactly like it would a vaccine.
Since it takes like 100 or so viral particles to make you sick, your body will mount a full-scale attack when it sees just a couple dozen protein markers that it's flagged as ""dangerous"".  But if it has made a mistake and has flagged something relatively innert... well... most things you're allergic to are going to have millions of these protein markers, so to your immune system it looks like you're practically septic all at once out of the blue, and your immune system is going to kick into mega-overdrive, damn-the-consequences mode to try to deserately save your life against the shellfish you just ate, in a way that is very dangerous for a healthy person.  
The only way we know to get your body to knock it the hell off is to simulate a bear attack so your body knows to stop trying to save your life from microbes and instead focus on the bear.  Essentially you just have to hit a bigger more pressing panic button than dying of infection, and that takes the form of a big ole shot of what is essentially adrenaline straight to the bloodstream (an epi-pen).  
Now it is possible to de-sensitize yourself over time to various allergens through something called allergen immunotherapy, which slowly convinces your immune system that the threat is less dire than it initially estimated by continually exposing you to larger and larger amounts eventually your immune system can calm down and figure out these ""viral particles"" it's identified just aren't a huge priority as they... oddly... don't seem to replicate very quickly (since they are, of course, just shrimp proteins or whatever) but this can take a long time, and only works well for certain allergens and needs to be done under the careful supervision of a medical professional.  Although research does show that feeding your child peanutbutter consistently (like at least once a month) from an early age does seem to prevent the formation of something crazy like 99% of all peanutbutter allergies, and that is something you can do at home if your child isn't already allergic. 
The truth is it's complicated: there are certain kinds of exposure to things that are gonna make your immunr system infer that what it saw was a dangerous pathogen, there are certain kinds of exposure that make your immune system calm down a little.  It's very contextual and dependent on length of exposure to compounds.  Some of it is just luck.

Your body recognizes the threat, produces the antibodies to take care of it in reasonable amounts, ans then the threat gets utterly overwhelmed, ans you become better after a mild fever or something.
That mild fever will always happen, whenever you catch the disease. When you have an allergic reaction, it's that same mild fever turned up to 1,000.
In the case of catching a disease, and then catching it a second time, your immune system does a little damage to you in order to vastly reduce the damage the disease does to you, the second time around.

yrbd3f,https://www.reddit.com/user/Nyrin,1,"Generally, all allergen immunotherapy treatments are prescription-only with supervised administration by a provider.
Although sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is regarded as safer and is much more commonly self-adminstered at home, treatment plans with dose increases are still individually calibrated by a prescribing physician using repeat challenge tests to supplement reported reactions as needed.
Really severe reactions are rare with subcutaneous (SQ) and even more rare with SL administration, but it doesn't really meet the typical safety thresholds that most aim for when making something over-the-counter.
It isn't just a safety thing, though; 

Allergen immunotherapy is very specific and you need good testing to even target the right things. You can't just subcutaneously or sublingually administer ""grass pollen"" and expect improvement; it needs to be somewhat closer to a precise species of grass to work. That means you need someone to do the infamous scratch/pinprick test to even know what you should be taking and at what dose you should start with, and that's not a DIY thing of any normal caliber.
Efficacy of allergen immunotherapy relies on a highly individualized dose progression; different patients will increase dose/frequency, hold a regimen, or even ""fall back"" to previous/lower doses based on all sorts of complexities. A self-guided OTC protocol, whether SLIT or SQIT, would likely have abysmal long-term success rates as it's not one-size-fits-all. It's far from perfect even with close monitoring and adjustments.

It's a bit unnerving, but the full extent of all of the mechanisms involved aren't really entirely understood. We know that progressive exposure gradually reduces IgE expression and ""moves"" response to IgG4/IgA (which fits with diminished histiminic response) but the second-order mechanisms that control that up-/down-regulation, especially with protection after discontinuation, were still pretty mysterious the last I read up on it.

yrbd3f,https://www.reddit.com/user/thetomahawk42,1,"Interestingly it's possible to treat some allergies (like peanut) in a kinda-similar-ish way to vaccines.
The idea is to introduce very small amounts of the proteins, and gradually, over several months, increased this amount.  This allows the immune system to build up a tolerance to the protein.
The person will never get to the point where they can eat a packet of peanuts, but can certainly get to the point where cross-contamination of food or accidentally eating a small amount of nuts won't kill them.

Though vaccines work the way the do by tricking the immune system, it isn’t always necessary to need one to fight a virus. Best practice is to look into how to enhance the function of the microbiome, supplement with immunomodulators and adaptogenic herbs and fungus, and keep a generally clean diet (avoid alcohol as that has detrimental effects to the microbiome)

yrbd3f,https://www.reddit.com/user/Gloomy-Giraffe,0,"u/Tanooki is mistaken. Stopping immune pathways is one approach. But, the other is as you suspect. By exposing the body to the allergen, you can shift the response away from general, IgE mediated inflammatory responses, to specific immunity, such as antibodies that attach to and neutralize the substance, macrophages that can eat or neutralize the substance, and other mediating capabilities (such as blocking receptor sites on affected tissue or adapting to not initiate a histological response.)
In the case of most allergies, achieving this requires carefully dosed exposures for long periods, but doing so causes long lasting adaptation if successful. It is successful in about 70% of cases.
Historically, it has been used in patients with deadly but common allergies, but now is being expanded to people even with moderate (such as season grass) and uncommon allergies, as it has been found to reduce lifetime risk of developing more serious autoimmune and vascular conditions, options and procedures have improved, and the overall cost has reduced.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen_immunotherapy#:~:text=Allergen%20immunotherapy%2C%20also%20known%20as,change%20the%20immune%20system%27s%20response.
Note, this approach also works for many poisonous substances, where resistance can be built up against toxic chemicals. The mechanisms are the same, The body achieves high rates of neutralizing antibodies and/or blocking or adjusting rates of affected receptors.
Also note, because the general mechanism of allergies and toxins is the chemical's effect on cellular pathways, it lacks many of the points of intervention of viral and bacterial immunity. In viruses, your body can protect itself by adjusting the biology of, or entirely killing, cells that would otherwise become producers of more viral material. Neutralizing the actual virus is far less important than preventing replication. Similarly, with bacteria, the organism must often be killed or isolated/balanced in population. while, in both of these cases, there may be components of neutralizing offensive chemicals as well, much of the response is around addressing these replicative points, and failure to do so will result in long term infection. With chemicals irritants (including allergens or toxins produced by organisms) your body has fewer options, again, primarily neutralizing the chemical by binding to it, blocking attachment points, or adapting to not initiate a response.

From what I remember, T2 cells are used to attack parasitic infections. They are also what respond to allergies I believe. Because parasites are not as common in developed countries, the T2 cells sit around like an under stimulated puppy that eventually finds something to cure its boredom. The T2 cells have nothing to do, so they find something to react to aka allergies. This is why some people have found benefits to hook worms. They are worms that don’t breed in their host, so they don’t multiply making it relatively okay to have them feeding off you. Because they want to continue living in their host, they excrete a saliva that helps your immune response not overreact to allergies and can even help IBS

At present, there is still not a single explanation for their formation as far as I know, but recent publications have suggested they may be related to deposition during flow of water in a former connection between the Black and Caspian Seas, i.e., the Manych Strait (e.g., Badyukova, 2018) or as a result of deposition during rapid fall of the level of the Caspian Sea (e.g., Melnikova & Pokazeev, 2020).

Smoking weed makes your mouth dry which in turn makes you drink more. That’s causation. But it doesn’t hold the other way. Nothing what about that.
Correlation is always bidirectional, causation is not.
Also, the correlation is about drinking more than usual. Just drinking water, while still being correlated, is a bad aspect to focus on. Because every human drinks water in their lifetime, so you can correlate it to everything, making it meaningless on its own. Like breathing air as a correlation is meaningless. You need to be more specific. Drinking less than 2L water per day, drinking more water per day, drinking water in a certain area, etc. can all give you good correlations that might even result in finding causations. But using things everybody does gives you 0 additional knowledge.

Regardless, the definition of caused(a,b) is somewhat irrelevant to the proof in my earlier comment. It works even if you interpret
caused(a,b) as a eats b for breakfast. The ""theorem""  is that (correlated(a,b) →caused(a,b)) →(correlated(a,b) →(caused(a,b) and caused(b,a)). You have to assume correlation implies causation before you get the conclusion, that correlation implies mutual causation.

SCI-FI is also a good way to increase your vocabulary in sciency fields. You can get at the same level of comprehension(vocabulary) of a university student just by reading lots of sci-fi books that are compelling to you. Or by just reading papers (but only if you actually enjoy doing that).

From the article:

Participants:

A representative sample of 1,962 Taiwanese community-dwelling older persons aged 64 and above, followed up in four waves of surveys over 14 years.
Measurements:
Baseline reading frequencies were measured based on a scale of leisure activity. The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire was used to measure cognitive performance. We performed logistic regression to assess associations between baseline reading and later cognitive decline. Interaction terms between reading and education were to compare the reading effects on cognitive decline at different education levels.
Results:
After adjusting for covariates, those with higher reading frequencies (≥1 time a week) were less likely to have cognitive decline at 6-year (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34–0.86), 10-year (AOR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37–0.92), and 14-year (AOR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34–0.86); in a 14-year follow-up, a reduced risk of cognitive decline was observed among older people with higher reading frequencies versus lower ones at all educational levels.

Abstract
Objective:
This study examined the effect of daily life reading activity on the risk of cognitive decline and whether the effect differs regarding education levels.
Design:
A longitudinal study with 6-, 10-, and 14-year follow-up.
Setting:
Face-to-face interviews with structured questionnaires at home.
Participants:
A representative sample of 1,962 Taiwanese community-dwelling older persons aged 64 and above, followed up in four waves of surveys over 14 years.
Measurements:
Baseline reading frequencies were measured based on a scale of leisure activity. The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire was used to measure cognitive performance. We performed logistic regression to assess associations between baseline reading and later cognitive decline. Interaction terms between reading and education were to compare the reading effects on cognitive decline at different education levels.
Results:
After adjusting for covariates, those with higher reading frequencies (≥1 time a week) were less likely to have cognitive decline at 6-year (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34–0.86), 10-year (AOR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37–0.92), and 14-year (AOR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34–0.86); in a 14-year follow-up, a reduced risk of cognitive decline was observed among older people with higher reading frequencies versus lower ones at all educational levels.
Conclusions:
Reading was protective of cognitive function in later life. Frequent reading activities were associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline for older adults at all levels of education in the long term.

Introduction
High level of cognitive functional capacity is one of the major components of successful aging (Rowe and Kahn, 1997). The World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the importance of cognitive function in determining health in its policy framework on active aging (WHO, 2002). Cognitive decline is a normal process of aging (Harada et al., 2013). Mild cognitive impairment is a greater cognitive decline beyond one’s age without interfering with daily life activities; dementia is characterized by more severe and widespread cognitive impairments that substantially influence daily functions (Gauthier et al., 2006). The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment over the age of 60 ranges from 6.7% to 25.2% and increases with age (Petersen et al., 2018). The number of persons with dementia worldwide was estimated to be 46.8 million in 2015, resulting in 818 billion USD worth of societal costs (Prince, 2015). In East Asia, the region of the most populations living with dementia, the prevalence of dementia in older people aged 60 or older was 4.5% in 2015 (Prince, 2015). In Taiwan, the prevalence of cognitive impairment among older adults aged 65 and over was 22% (Wu et al., 2011) and that of dementia was 5.7% (Wu et al., 2013), respectively. Dementia affected 210,000 Taiwanese older adults by 2020 and is projected to affect 710,000 by 2060 (Wu et al., 2013).

Cognitive impairments and dementia could predict premature death (Sachs et al., 2011; Todd et al., 2013). Loss of cognitive function was associated with reduced functional abilities of daily living, compromised well-being, and lower life satisfaction (Comijs et al., 2005; Mehta et al., 2002; St. John and Montgomery, 2010). In addition to normal aging, cognitive decline and impairments may be induced by lack of practice (Mackinnon et al., 2003), anxiety, depression or other neuropsychiatric symptoms (Lara et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2011; Potvin et al., 2011), vascular factors (Baumgart et al., 2015; Debette et al., 2011), substance use and medication (Anstey et al., 2009; Fox et al., 2011), loneliness (Boss et al., 2015), low social support, and isolation (Kelly et al., 2017). The process of cognitive decline could be slowed by involvement in regular physical activity (Ma et al., 2017; Northey et al., 2018), avoiding smoking (Baumgart et al., 2015), adopting particular dietary patterns and nutrient intake (Lee et al., 2017; Solfrizzi et al., 2017), or more engagement in social life and leisure activity (Ghisletta et al., 2006; Glei et al., 2005).
Cognitively stimulating activities, or intellectual activities, are recognized as a lifestyle factor in preserving cognitive function in the aged (Hultsch et al., 1999; Mackinnon et al., 2003). Studies have shown that cognitively stimulating or intellectual activities, including reading, watching TV, listening to radio, playing games, puzzling, or gambling was associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline in later life (Gallucci et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2018; Leung et al., 2011; Litwin et al., 2017; Verghese et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2002). Most studies have adopted a composite measure of cognitive activities and less is known about the effects of a specific activity. To engage actively in daily life, activities may differ in their corresponding cognitive tasks and the amounts of intellectual stimulation required for active engagement (Ghisletta et al., 2006). Besides, different activities might offset each other in their effects on cognitive function (Gallucci et al., 2009; Lindstrom et al., 2005; Lopes et al., 2012; Lovden et al., 2005). Research evidence for any specific activity is warranted.
Reading is a typical intellectual activity. Compared with other leisure activities, such as physical and social activities, it is more sedentary and isolated. Reading for leisure has proven to have health benefits for older people in prolonging life (Jacobs et al., 2008), and cognition may mediate between reading and survival advantage (Bavishi et al., 2016).

It sounds like leisure reading and even watching TV and other activities also, help. Based on that, u would assume Reddit counts.

Kardashians probably isnt as good as history channel for example and reddit could be good if you follow subredits which gives more valuable information compared to shitposting subs.

y774y0,https://www.reddit.com/user/regular_modern_girl,2,"Keep in mind that, at least with Chinese languages, it’s not like a speaker has to memorize all ten thousand-and-whatever characters used in modern written Chinese, they don’t even have to memorize the vast majority. 
Han characters are all composed of fundamental parts called radicals, of which there are just 214, and in addition to each radical being a character onto itself with a specific meaning and pronunciation (the latter of which obviously varies between the many languages that use Han characters in their writing), all other characters are basically composites of multiple radicals together. In Chinese languages iirc, you can actually discern “hints” to both the meaning and pronunciation of any character based on which radicals (or other characters) are placed where (like I know that the one either to the left or on the top—depending on the character—is either the “semantic determinative” or “phonetic determinative”, and the ones on the right or bottom are the other determinative, but obviously I forget which is which), unless obviously the character in question is just one of the 214 basic radicals. This is still obviously somewhat more complex and more stuff to memorize than learning the Latin alphabet, but it means that there’s still usually a way to get some idea of what word a character represents without having to having to visually memorize most of a dictionary (speaking of which, there’s also a traditional ordering to the radicals, like equivalent to an alphabetic ordering, and that’s how Chinese and Japanese dictionaries are indexed if you’ve ever wondered about that).
In Japanese, however, the system doesn’t quite work the same way. Japanese adapted Chinese characters for its writing, but Japanese is not only not closely related to Chinese languages, but is also just morphologically, grammatically, and typologically a really different language, so the way it uses Han characters (or kanji, as they are known in Japanese) is a lot more convoluted and unintuitive, two additional native Japanese syllable-based systems (both collectively known as kana) are needed for certain linguistic particles and other aspects of language that Chinese languages just don’t really have (like prefixes and suffixes, in that Chinese islanguages are very uninflected language compared to Japanese), and there are certain systems for giving phonetic glosses to unfamiliar characters that even native Japanese speakers need the help of sometimes. The latter issue mostly comes from the fact that while the “semantic determinative” portion of the radicals still (mostly) holds up with Japanese use of kanji, Japanese being such a different language means that the “phonetic determinative” part usually doesn’t work except with direct Chinese loanwords (and even those can be confusing, because they were mostly adopted into Japanese from Middle Chinese, which is quite different from modern Mandarin, or really any modern Chinese language), and to make matters even worse, there are a ton of entirely different possible readings for a lot of different kanji, which is almost like the equivalent of if English was full of words that were spelled one way but could be pronounced several absolutely dissimilar ways, and sometimes not even mean quite the same thing (I guess with all the homophones/homographs in English we almost do have something a bit like this, although not nearly to the same degree). So with written Japanese, there actually is a significant amount of rote memorization and learning to recognize context that is required (which is why it’s arguably the most confusingly-written language currently in use).
EDIT: oh yeah, forgot to mention, the traditional ordering of the 214 radicals is actually based on stroke count (like how many distinct strokes it takes to write each of them), from fewest to most strokes.

y774y0,https://www.reddit.com/user/EricTheNerd2,366,"Short answer: probably. Multiple studies have shown that mental activity correlates with lower Alzheimer's risk. For example from  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32498728/
""After adjusting for covariates, those with higher reading frequencies (≥1 time a week) were less likely to have cognitive decline at 6-year (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.86), 10-year (AOR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37-0.92), and 14-year (AOR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86); in a 14-year follow-up, a reduced risk of cognitive decline was observed among older people with higher reading frequencies versus lower ones at all educational levels.""
Now as we all know, correlation doesn't mean causation. It could be that folks who are predisposed to Alzheimer's are also predisposed not to read. I tend to doubt that but I have not seen any peer-reviewed double-blind studies on the subject. If someone has seen one, please point me to it.
I am not a doctor but have concerns about Alzheimer's because ... well... it seems like one of the worst ways to die. A slow decline where you become someone different and even lose memories of those you love and in many cases become abusive towards those you love. I'd rather just end it than put my family through that.

Another unethical reason is the expectation of harm, it's like asking one group to smoke cigarettes, knowing that subjects in that group would experience deleterious outcomes by doing so. Subjects would even have to sign a consent form acknowledging that possibility, and an Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board would not allow such a study.
Impractical because of the size that such a study would need to be. Assuming that a validated instrument exists for measuring cognitive ability across multiple ethnicities, socioeconomic groups, and geographic locations, the size of the predicted effect may be small and highly variable. If the effect size is small and variable, the groups would need to contain a LOT of subjects in order to show that any difference observed was statistically meaningful (as well as being clinically relevant). All of this would have to be done in a randomized manner to avoid bias, and if everything worked, that just establishes the feasibility of the intervention. In order to support it, other studies would need to be conducted to show that it was repeatable, there was a ""dose effect"" (e.g., amount of reading correlated with better cognitive scores), rule out effects of other diseases (co-morbidities that occur with age could interfere with findings), and show that the effect persists over time (a single test at the end of the treatment is not adequate for what's being claimed).

Reading could fall under cognitive stimulation and cognitive training e.g. mentally challenging tasks that can improve specific domains like memory and processing speed. Reading to help learn a new language, topic, or hobby would count.
Evidence from trials and observational studies have provided moderate evidence of improving cognition or delaying its decline in the short term. The evidence is stronger than correlation because it’s prospective e.g. you measure how much people read at baseline, exclude people with AD, and follow them for incident events over time and account for age, education, etc.
AD is difficult to study because it’s thought to develop over decades, AD influences behaviors we think protect against AD, and AD isn’t common until older adulthood. We’re not even sure anymore what the early pathological marks are, as accumulating evidence suggests that amyloid and tau are more downstream.
Ideally we would study AD progression and risk factors by recruiting large studies of people during middle age and following them for decades like we did decades ago to study heart disease. Think in the range of hundreds of thousands of people. If in a randomized trial, we’d assign them to read for decades. Then you can study some midlife exposure like what and how much someone reads (and exercises, eats, drinks, etc), collect biospecimens and store them regularly for future tech to measure new biomarkers etc., and look at incident AD. This is exactly what these decades old heart disease observational studies like Framingham have done, but by now most participants have left or died so samples are small. Newer studies like All of Us and UK biobank are getting at this, but are balancing out what they can measure in terms of cost and coverage (questionnaires are cheap but don’t measure well, other tools are more expensive but measure better and there’s only enough money to use this measure in a subset). Plus, the measures available at the time e.g. simple questions like how much do you read each week don’t capture reading type and volume well. This plays into the moderate evidence part. This kind of undertaking is extremely expensive, but still a pretty small amount given the whole NIH budget.
The 3 most promising interventions appear to be physical exercise, blood pressure control, and cognitive training. Thus the saying “what’s good for the heart is good for the brain”. Learning a new physically demanding activity can get at all these in one go e.g. when I got into backpacking in my early 20s, I was running daily to get in shape and devoured books on exercise physiology, science, etc.

There are several factors driving these effects. Increased blood flow to the brain helps to keep the neurovascular system and proximal neural tissue  healthy. Engaging with novel and challenging cognitive tasks will also help to maintain neuroplasticity by activating more neural tissue more often. In both cases, the old saying “use it or lose it” applies.

First, I am assuming that you mean the slow gradual cognitive decline that starts a little earlier in life. Eventually, we all fall off a cognitive cliff, the variance is in how close to the end it happens if we live long enough. 
The two areas that cover this the most are brain reserve and cognitive reserve. Brain reserve is literally how big is your brain, so reading does help there. Cognitive reserve is influenced by genetics, education, environmental factors, and reading would hit that. 
Ultimately what I found when conducting Alzheimer’s research for my doctorate was that people who engage in many of these cognitively protective factors generally do so out of enjoyment, not because they are worried about decline.

The short answer is no, but the long answer is yes.  Reading passively is about as effective as listening to music.  Yet if you are referring to reading in the pursuit of learning then that does reduce the likelihood of senile dementia.

Your diet is important too. The brain is extremely hungry from doing all those exercises after all! Carbs, protein, good fats like fish oil. Furthermore the foods you eat may affect the gut biome which as a relatively new area of research suggests that a good gut biome may positively affect brain health. There was a case study where a man was given antibiotics in the hospital where it wiped out his gut bacteria and it adversely caused him depression.

y774y0,https://www.reddit.com/user/Drew_Trox,4,"Yes, but you also need to diversify. Your brain is always striving for cognitive ease. So reading consistently will help some, but over time it will just be an easy task for your brain. Especially if you stick to a specific genre, author, and language. Also, reading isn't fully engaging your brain. An improvement would be to read aloud while listening to music on a hike. It's like bodybuilding, you can work the glamor muscles, but if you want real health you engage the whole body.
My suggestion to stave off cognitive decline is challenge and novelty. You want cognitive tasks that are difficult and ever changing. For example, always be learning new skills. I'd say writing a novel is more beneficial than reading one. 
The other part is novelty. I'd say a brain that is always listening to new music will be healthier than one who listens to only one album. Again your brain wants to be as efficient as possible. Which is good for the short term, but after a long life will lead to atrophy.
What is a youthful childlike brain like? It is always being bombarded by the challenge of acquiring skills, and everything is new.
Also, play video games.

The terms we have been exposed to relating to reduced chance of AD are cognitive reserves. Basically the more stimulation the brain gets, it grows and have reserves of brain matter and increased associative networks to serve as memory traces. The connections between different brain networks also is improved. 
People with AD can still have the disease without showing behavioral signs because the brain compensates for the neuroatrophy if the cognitive reserves are sufficient. So a person with good cognitive reserves can still show the same biomarkers for AD as a person with low reserves and full blown AD, but show less behavioral and cognitive decline.
Factors related to increasing cogntive reserves include intellectual activities (reading, writing, being creative), good and healthy social network, good diet, physical activity (workout, traveling). Education has been exposed as being correlated with cogntive reserves and AD as it provides and approximately 40% increase in protection (higher education = better). Additionally, simple repetative jobs are not good for cognitive reserves and AD, while more complex jobs (service, engineering, etc) provide better protection.

She is an avid reader. Reads books constantly. And she always has been a big fan of mystery novels. Her favorites are Lisa Scottoline and James Patterson. She also keeps her mind busy with word games. 
She is starting to lose it though. Still reading everyday. But my parents and family when dropping off books have found they can recycle books she read a few months ago and she thinks they are new. 
So the cognitive decline is there. She is still with it. But moments of lucidity are getting to be more few and far between.

My current client with Alzheimer’s was a man with thousands of books in his library, every one he read. Incredibly articulate man with a high IQ and just someone who was/is a pleasure hearing speak. He was also fit/athletic his entire life, eating healthy, etc.
Does reading help? Probably. Does exercise help? Sure. But these aren’t guarantees, and the data on these things preventing anything are inconclusive at best; we know these things are general practices for extending life and reducing risks for other conditions/diseases. As much as I think these studies demonstrate some improvement or help to slow things down, it’s just not that convincing. 
Out of the thousands of people/clients I’ve worked with and been around in their homes and facilities, only a small percentage of them were people who lived unhealthy lifestyles and/or weren’t readers.

Often their affliction causes decline in their health and interests, with their underlying condition affecting them earlier on before any real symptoms show up.
We know things like APOE e4 gene markers increase your chances more than anything. So until we actually cure and discover the “cause,” I’d hesitate to put all my eggs into the “read more” and “be healthy” basket. Do these things to prevents risks in general.

There are variants that have been modified so that the gene responsible for combining sugars into starches is not present, so the kernels remain very sweet all year. My father was among the people who identified the gene, isolated it, modified the plant, and then bred the modified plant into healthy stock, which is how I know this.

There are several subtypes of fruit, two of those subtypes being ""accessory"" and ""aggregate."" Accessory fruit occur when another part of the flower grows alongside the fruit. Aggregate fruit occur when one flower has clusters of ovaries. Strawberries are kind of interesting in that the fleshy part that you think of as the fruit is actually the part of the flower that simply holds all of the flower's ovaries. The ovaries turn into those little seed things all over the outside of the flesh. THOSE things are technically the fruit of the plant. One of those little ""seeds"" is called an achene.

Micronutrients (sodium, potassium, etc) remain unchanged through ripening, however.

This is simply not true. Many fruits and vegetables accumulate (or lose) micro nutrients during ripening. Ripe oranges have less vitamin C in them than unripe ones. Mangoes go in the other direction. Unripe tomatoes essentially contain no Lycopene. Some fruits accumulate dietary minerals, some lose minerals like potassium and magnesium
Edit: It's not even true that mass is conserved, plenty fruits accumulate mass during the ripening process, though typically little in the very final ripening or harvesting stages. Though some melons can add appreciable mass between the start and end of the harvesting period (typically taken to be the end state of the whole ripening process), as can some chilli peppers.

This is so broad that it negates the concept of ""same"" and ""different"". OP obviously knows the constituent subatomic particles don't change.
As fruit ripens, its quantity of each particle certainly changes, as does the molecules they compose. The size, color, flavor, texture, and moisture content all change when a fruit ripens, so it's reasonable to ass

Nutritionally, however; sucrose, fructose, and glucose are all different from each other.

I'd nitpick this and say that they're nutritionally the same, but metabolically different. They're interchangeable in terms of nutrition, in the sense that you can consume exclusively either glucose or fructose and get calories from them.

Soluble fiber is digested and does get converted to energy with the help of beneficial bacteria in your gut.  Without gut bacteria, you would not be able to digest a thing.
Insoluble - Can’t digest
Soluble - Can digest
Soluble and insoluble fiber is in many plant foods we eat everyday.  Beans, rice, lettuce, celery, corn, apples etc. 
Fiber is highly recommended to be a part of the diet, because it promotes healthy gut bacteria, because it gives it something to cling to and grow.  Your immune system is also heavily dependent on healthy flora in the gut.

It's a building block molecule that can bond into rings, webs, and chains, which accounts for several things on the Nutrition Facts label. The strongest bonded glucose is called Fiber, and humans cannot digest it. The moderately bonded glucose is called starch, which gets accounted for in the Carbohydrate grams. The simplest forms, glucose (or a similar arrangement that comes out of photosynthesis, fructose) are called Sugar. When you digest these things, the bonds break down (and your liver converts the fructose) and it all becomes unbonded glucose. This takes different amounts of time, slow-release vs fast-release, so we name them differently since they affect us differently. The glucose in plants bonds and unbonds as it grows. Enzymes in the plant can break Fiber (cellulose) into starch and starch into glucose, especially when a fruit is ripening. And so, the Nutrition Facts amounts of each will change as it ripens. Of course, they can't measure and remeasure each fruit, so the FDA just publishes fully ripened amounts. But, if a fruit tastes starchy and underripe, it has less sugar than if it ripened.

y4t646,https://www.reddit.com/user/regular_modern_girl,9,"yeah genes are just sequences of codons which each correspond to an amino acid subunit of a protein, certain amino acids have to be in just the right places in a protein’s structure for it to not end up as a useless squiggly mess (useless at best, potentially toxic at worst, just look at the formation of amyloid plaques), and if even one base pair is off in DNA, that changes a given codon to another one (meaning there will be the wrong amino acid, and the whole protein is probably ruined).
I do 3D printing, and kind of think protein synthesis and folding as similar in a certain way; when you’re 3D printing something (on a FDM printer, at least), all it takes is one little crossing of one layer being set down wrong, and before you know it, you have an unrecognizable mass of plastic spaghetti that doesn’t resemble what you were originally trying to print in the slightest, and you have no choice but to toss the whole thing in the recycle bin and start over. The problem is, with misfolded proteins there sometimes isn’t any “starting over” if they’re essential enough to a cell, and there often isn’t an analogue to a recycle bin either (so some misfolded proteins can just keep accumulating until there’s severe disease).
Basically, in both cases all it takes is one small error, and an entire print/protein ceases to be functional.
This is why mutations that lead to disease are generally more common than ones which end up being beneficial (as for an organism to benefit, it basically takes the altered protein actually being better than the original, or good for something else).

y4t646,https://www.reddit.com/user/adc34,1,"I don't agree with so much in your comment, that I have to reply, sorry. First of all, we don't start with the same gene set. Ok, maybe we did 4 billions years ago, but it's a pure speculation and we don't have any instruments to infer anything valuable from the fact that 'there was a single organism at some point of time from which everything evolved'. I'm pretty sure the whole picture is much-much more complicated. As for humans, I can say with a high confidence that there was not a single human being evolved that become the genesis of all humans. Specification is a complex thing and there's always a period of hybridisations with closely related species. I won't delve into it deeper, but some fishes even rely on other species for their reproduction. This fish is actually really amazing and there's a lot to unpack with its reproduction.
Secondly, there's no such thing as random distribution that does something for organism fitness. The species that got an appropriate set of genes (and maybe even more than genes, like some epigenetic markers) survived. The ones who didn't, didn't. That's it. In many organisms there's not a unique set of genes (""formula"") that lets it survive in a given environment. Gene regulation is incredibly intricate and has a ton of feedback loops. For example some genes, that are very important are often duplicated, like ribosomal or histone genes, and mutations in them doesn't do much.

The white community in this country is the smallest, however they are the most wealthy, mainly due to the businesses they developed since preindependence. 
My personal experience working for a white person was one of being belittled infront of collègues, hearing basically racist comments, a huge pay disparity between white people and black people. 
The white community generally doesn’t do business with black people and if they do the amount that they will charge will be more than if it was with another white person.

Sure! But very few even hypothetical objects could disrupt Mars in such a way where the inclination of its orbit (or escape, in this case) that wouldn't be so massive that its simple existence would also cause us issues. 

Additionally the asteroid belt isn’t dense like in the movies and even if Mars DID disrupt things there there’s nothing that says it would do so in such a way that they would have near term impact on Earth. Space is big.

You're a bit misguided here. Yeah, it's not like the asteroid field in Empire Strikes Back. But gravity's ""reach"" is large and minor perturbations in asteroid's orbits caused by Mars passing through would have far-reaching effects that would undoubtedly cause asteroid strikes. Not by, as you seem to be imagining, directing launching them at Earth, but by putting them in more eccentric orbits that are more likely to intersect with us.

near term impact on Earth. Space is big.

Which is why I very explicitly said a short timescale in astronomical terms. Space is big, but Earth has been pounded with asteroids every day for its entire existence. Mars disrupting the asteroid belt  would undeniably increase the rate of those hits, and by extension the rate of large asteroid strikes.

I think you’d have to slow it down quite a bit.  The moon is in a pretty high orbit

is getting farther and farther away from us, like inches a year or something like that, that means it’s orbital speed is slightly faster than earths gravity can handle

It is slowly moving out, like you say.  But it’s moving out because its speed is continually increasing, due to tidal forces from Earth, not because it’s present speed is too high. 

but if you slow it down, earths gravity overcomes it’s speed and sucks it in

It wouldn’t “spiral” in, if that’s what you’re suggesting.  A sudden slowdown would lower its orbit immediately (to a more elliptical orbit).  But this new lower orbit would very slowly rise back up, due to the same tidal forces raising the moon today. 
If it stays mostly in one piece, then it will either hit our atmosphere pretty quick, within a month, or not at all.  Not unless it’s inside Earth’s Roche limit, in which case it will slowly break apart over many centuries.

Unless the thing that hits mats [Mars] is the size of a planet and manages to yeet it out of the solar system, or into earths orbit, there’s basically no chance of it affecting earth.

Even if it is the size of a planet, it's unlikely.  The leading working hypothesis for the origin of the Moon is that it was a planet about the size of Mars that sat at the Earth L4 or L5 point (a trojan).   The impact pretty much obliterated the planet I'min question (Theia) an did a number on Earth, but the material from the impact still staying largely in Earth's orbit where it formed into the Moon.
More generally: it takes a LOT more energy to move the any substantial chunk of the debris of a destroyed planet out of it's orbit than it does to destroy the planet. 
We'd basically be discussing a minor increase in the risk of asteroid strikes for the Mars scenario, while the Moon scenario would likely be an enormous mass extinction event in the best case scenario.

A lot of energy either way, but the binding energy of a planet is typically waaaaay above what’s needed to shorten its orbit significantly.
Getting a planet to escape velocity is admittedly a different matter. You’re talking very similar numbers in that case, assuming a best case scenario of a perfect nudge from behind in the direction of travel.
There’s also decent evidence that Earth’s orbit has changed in the past (very possibly due to the theism collision), as most planets have a significant number of asteroids in their L4 and L5 regions, while earth has essentially none.
That’s a bit strange, but less so if something disturbed earth’s orbit in a significant way in the past, which would have disturbed those asteroids from those stable orbits.

You are correct, and I should have been more specific.  I didn't really consider the orbital alteration case for your comment at all, and was mostly focused on the ""intoyeet earthsout orbitof the solar system"" part.  Orbital -alteration whichsignificant enough to put it into Earth's path is substantially more likely (for the given value of ""substantially"" that applies to this kind of insanely-unlikely hypothetical).  
Your point about the gravitational binding energy point you're making is actually reflective of what I was trying to point out: even if you manage to blast a planet into rubble, you will still generally see the rubble re-form into a planet (maybe with a new, bonus moon) in largely the same orbit.  Earth was largely intact after the the Theia impact, but (unless I'm more out of date than I thought) Theia was less so - and it still ended up forming into the Moon.

Go look at the difference in energy numbers I gave.
Pay very close attention to the power at the end.
Make sure you understand what that means.
That 72 m/s is enough to change the earths orbit by around 0.5% of the current distance. It’s also a fraction of the earths binding energy.
Adding 12km/s would be enough to put earth into An escape orbit, and that would require around 4.457x1032J. That’s not much more than the earths gravitational binding energy, and that’s the energy to leave the solar system not just alter the orbit.

In terms of slowing the moon down overcoming its binding energy, I don't think so. Moon orbits at 1 km/s. Escape velocity is 2.4. The binding energy of the moon exceeds its orbital kinetic energy by a factor of 3 or so.
You may well melt it or turn it inside out but you're not gonna splatter it completely just by deorbitting it. Rest assured that after colliding the moon into an indestructible immovable massless wall at orbital speed, it will, in fact, bounce.
Indeed, the moon is one of the few objects in the solar system who's binding energy exceeds its orbital kinetic energy relative to its parent body. This definitely isn't true of Earth or Mars. Nor either of Mars' tiny captured moons in low orbits with almost no gravity. It's definitely not true of Mercury or Venus or any mainbelt asteroids relative to the sun. It's true of all the gas giants. But it's not true of any of their moons AFAICT. All of them fail the bounce test.
Funnily enough, it is true for Charon and Pluto relative to their barycenter.
I'm unaware of any object in orbit of a barycenter around a smaller body that refuses to satisfy this property relative to the barycenter. I suspect it might actually be impossible for this to occur. Thus that makes it a useful concept for determining the difference between ""dual planets"" and small moons. Though perhaps instead of orbital kinetic energy you could use the total orbital energy. For non-relativistic orbits it's the same number though, just negative.
This acts as a direct comparison and asks the simple question, what is this object more affected by, its parent's gravity or its own gravity?
For the moon, the answer is that the moon is somewhat more affected by its own gravity than ours. Making it somewhat of a dual planet.

The short answer is no, it's highly unlikely there could ever be an impact event large enough on either the moon or Mars to seriously affect life on Earth. Maybe in the first billion years or so of the solar system when there were huge planetesimals still playing cosmic pinball, but not now. 
Here's the longer answer:
To start with, the only things affecting the moon or Mars that could potentially affect life on Earth are the moon breaking up/changing orbit or Mars breaking up/changing orbit in such a way that it affects our orbit in the long term, and this assumes the change is such that life cannot adapt and/or we somehow lose the things that make it habitable here like a thick atmosphere and liquid water. In the case of the moon undergoing a change due to an impact, the effect on Earth would be pretty quick in geologic terms. For Mars, any change we see here would take longer because it takes time for planetary systems to reach a new gravitational equilibrium.
To make any of these things happen you would either need something like a massive body impacting the moon/Mars or some kind of gravitational hijinks like a rogue black hole or rogue planet passing through the solar system. Even asteroids similar to the size that caused the K-Pg extinction 66 million years ago would have no real effect on Earth unless it hit Earth. Even something large enough to create an impact basin like the South Pole-Aitken basin on the moon (2500 km diameter) or Hellas Planitia on Mars (2300 km diameter) wouldn't affect us here. Such an event on the moon would kick up a lot of debris, some of which would fall to Earth, but any resulting impact from debris would not be large enough to cause a mass extinction or render Earth inhabitable.
Impact events generate a LOT of energy but unless it's an exceptionally massive impact event that literally changes the orbit of the moon or Mars it isn't going to do much to us unless the impact event occurs here, on Earth. It takes a ton of energy to shift the orbit of something as massive as a planet and there aren't any gigantic rogue planetesimals swinging through the solar system like there were billions of years ago.
The next question is, are you asking about long term habitability or about something immediately catastrophic? Because there's only one scenario I can think of that would cause immediate, catastrophic damage to life on Earth and that's the moon breaking up and sending some serious debris headed our way. Any other scenario I mentioned could potentially affect habitability in the long term but wouldn't result in a mass extinction event within your lifetime or perhaps not for millions of years. 
For the sake of argument, let's suspend what we know about the solar system and physics and assume a massive impact might actually happen. Yes, it is absolutely possible for a massive impact event on another body to affect us. It's absolutely possible for a sufficiently large impact to render Earth inhabitable in the long term. However the impact required to cause immediate catastrophe would need to be sufficiently large to actually shift the orbit of the body it's impacting in such a way that the moon breaks up/is pushed into a closer orbit (which could mean it impacts Earth in the future). Short of Mars being yeeted from the solar system, even the entire planet breaking up wouldn't have much effect on us here for at least thousands of years and probably closer to the scale of a million years or longer because again, it takes time for the solar system to reach a new gravitational equilibrium.
This topic has been addressed in scifi. Seveneves by Neal Stephenson describes a fictional scenario where the moon suddenly breaks up and is quite good imo if you like scifi. I've not read the original by H.G. Wells, but ""The Time Machine"" was loosely adapted into a movie where in one of the times the protagonist visits, the moon has broken up and he travels into a future where life has adapted.

To meaningfully change this, you'd need A LOT of kinetic energy. There's also no need for ""just the right angle"". Adding energy to an orbit is always most effective perpendiculartangent to the orbit, i.e. perfectly retrograde/prograde. Pushing Mars toward the Sun is a very ineffective way to make it closer to the Sun. You need to push Mars retrograde to do this.
Movies and TV perpetuate these bad ideas around orbital mechanics. Even The Expanse has a scene where they're talking about deorbiting Eros into the Sun using billiards terms and imagery. Guess what will actually deorbit an asteroid? Zeroing out its orbital velocity. To do that with a collision, you'd need to hit it with the same amount of kinetic energy as it has in its stable orbit in the exact reverse orbit (retrograde). Good luck with that, giant Mormon cathedral covered in fusion drives or no.

If you hit it at the wrong angle and add enough energy to it that it leaves our orbit that would have minimal short term impact on the planet. Tides would stop but that wouldn't instantly doom life on earth (there'd undoubtedly be various unpredictable long term effects, however). And if you hit it at certain angles it could be forced into a lower orbit (this wouldn't actually be a perfect retrograde, you'd need to knock it towards the planet but also increase it's total speed for the lower orbit to become somewhat stable) which would increase tides and causes all kinds of havoc without instantly wiping us out.

Of course those would have impacts on Earth, even catastrophic ones. We're in such a close system with the moon that a collision large enough to alter its orbit (which would be a much larger collision than what is required to sterilize the Earth, btw) might as well have hit the Earth.

Retrograde is an apparent motion of an orbital body to appear like it's moving backward in the sky.  I don't remember if is there is a specific term for a body moving in a counter-rotating orbit.
Asteroids the size of Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are large enough at the counter-rotating orbit and at the interstellar speed of Oumuamua could reduce the size of Mars' orbit by 2-3%.

Anything that happens with the Moon should concern us down here. A big impact could make pieces rain down on Earth and make things very difficult for us. An impactor big enough to shatter the Moon will probably disturb Earth's orbit to some degree as well. Depending on the size of the impactor and its speed, even more wild things can happen. If it is slow enough, a huge chunk of the impactor's mass could remain in the system and affect the nature of the Earth-Moon system. After the pieces have coalesced back into shape of course.
Mars is quite distant from us, which helps a lot. Mars meteorites have ended up on Earth, but meteorite impacts generally spread rocks like a shotgun across the Solar system. The question is whether it will yield rocks that are big enough to be a problem.
An impactor yielding meteorites big enough to truly affect the habitability of Earth would have to be truly gargantuan. Even more so considering that piercing kilometer-sized boulders off Mars is only the first step - they also have to fly off on a trajectory towards Earth to become an issue.

yf22zc,https://www.reddit.com/user/urzu_seven,3,"It depends on how massive you are talking.  
Lets start with Mars, since thats easier.  You'd have to have something that would rather dramatically affect Mar's orbit to have ANY impact on the Earth.  Even something that shifted its orbit noticeably would like have no significant direct impact on Earth given the distance involved.
So you'd have knock mars so completely off its normal orbit that it somehow intersected with Earths orbit or came pretty close, which would be...very bad.  Either you'd end up with a direct collision which would wipe out all life on earth or you'd get close enough to disrupt earths orbit and probably throw the moon out of whack as well, which would probably also end up ending all life on earth and you'd probably eventually end up with an Earth/Mars impact eventually.
The other possibility is an impact large enough to shatter mars.  Depending on how it happened you COULD see most of Mars remain in its current or similar orbit, simply as pieces akin to the asteroid belt.  However its also possible that some of those pieces, including possibly large ones, could be knocked into orbits that would collide with Earth which would obviously be bad.
And its possible, that any impact large enough to knock Mars significantly out of orbit and/or break it apart would be one and the same so the above scenarios might be the same scenario in the end.
The moon, being closer requires less dramatic, though still pretty significant impacts to have an affect on the earth.  
First you have an impact that disrupts the orbit of the moon but not enough to knock it into earth or out of earths orbit completely.  The immediate effect would be on the tides and thus global climate.  Depending on how close or how far it gets these effects might be more or less dramatic.  This would absolutely affect life on earth but might be survivable depending.
Second, you've got the simple doomsday scenario a moon/earth collision impact.  The moon hitting the earth would be an extinction event, plain and simple.  The earth MIGHT not lose all life, but if anything does survive its probably bacteria or stuff around thermal vents or something like that.  Humans would be screwed.
Third, is the broken moon event, which while less catastrophic than the direct moon impact is likely still very very bad.  An impact of that power is all but assured to send some sizable chunks of the moon into the earth which would be likely cataclysmic.  Assuming by some fluke of probability no major chunks impact earth in the immediate term your still going to lose the tides and see massive changes to the weather and ecosystem as a result.  Eventually SOME of those lunar pieces are going to come down, and depending on the size it could be really really bad.
So yeah, either the impact isn't big enough to have any near term effect (if any) OR we are seriously screwed.  There's not a lot of scenarios where the event is enough to have some non-catastrophic impact on earth, aka mild side effects or something.

It describes a world where an asteroid hits the moon and Knicks it into a closer but stable orbit. This leads to mass famine, floods, and increase in volcanic activities brought on by increases in volcanic activities due to the moons increase gravitational pull on the earth. It was a good read and lead to 2 sequels. I can also imagine if the moon was destroyed leading to asteroid strikes across the globe or eevne a ring system forming around earth. This could lead to mining the rings for raw msterials.. maybe even a Kessler syndrome where we cannot leave the earth .

In the extreme case, a large enough explosion anywhere could be bad for us if it's big enough to reach us (but that's pretty goofy on the scale of things).
An impact on Mars I feel like would be unlikely to disturb us, Mars is gravitationally distant enough to not destabilize our orbit even if it vanished. Maybe if the impact completely obliterated Mars there would be enough debris that some could reach us, but it would depend heavily on many factors (hell, based on time of year/positioning it might just get pulled into the Sun or Jupiter).
On the other hand, the Moon is VERY gravitationally significant to the Earth, both in the cosmic proximity level and in its impact on our ocean's tides. Disruptions to either or both of these would be VERY bad for humans and other life on earth.
So I'd wager that large impacts on the moon would be far more impactful to life on earth than impacts on Mars.

I would like to think that if we saw a rock the size of Australia smash into Mars someone would go, ""Hmmm...perhaps I should check that orbit for deviance.""
A shift in orbit could have a cascading effect...so perhaps Mars doesn't move significantly enough to harm Earth, BUT a shift could change the orbit on another body that affects another, and then another, etc.
So the ultimate consequence may not be known until the celestial billiard balls sort themselves out.
Even if Mars did suddenly come unhinged from its place in the solar system and end up crossing Earth's path it'd likely be a long time before we both ended up inhabiting the same place at the same time. Which is admittedly small comfort considering we'd all be just as dead regardless.

yf22zc,https://www.reddit.com/user/pds314,1,"First, Mars: Basically I would almost always rather have the comet hit Mars than still be out there with a possibility to hit Earth. I say comet because I doubt Phobos or an asteroid is really big enough to kick up enough debris into escape trajectories that it's a problem for Earth. However, if you take a Sedna-like object and give it a tiny kick at apoapsis, it could impact Mars and really throw out an immense amount of ejecta as well as changing Mars' orbit or outright blowing up the planet. Any of those scenarios would be very hazardous to Earth due to both destabilization of the orbits of the inner solar system, and the bombardment of it with ejecta for a very long period.
Second, the moon. Assuming the object is not enormous, this is a question of where on the moon an object hits. If it hits the east side of the moon, then ejecta is released into orbits or suborbital trajectories of Earth with apogee lower than the moon.
It is important to recognize that this debris gains substantial energy falling from the moon to Earth. It takes only 2.38 km/s of velocity to get to a lunar escape trajectory and transforming that into a collision course with Earth takes all of 30 m/s more. Yet on impact with Earth it will be moving 11 km/s. That is a nearly 21-fold increase in ejecta energy.
Thus, if much debris is kicked up on the moon, there is a high chance that it ends up raining down on Earth at some point. Maybe not immediately. It's not going to all perfectly deorbit, and some of it will land on the moon or escape entirely, but the fact that large amounts of relatively intact ejected debris will probably collide with Earth at some point is likely to cause some damage.
Without running a simulation I can't really say what the impactor size and location would need to be to cause, e.g. nuclear winter on Earth, respiratory failure of animals, or heating the upper atmosphere into a deadly space heater that sets forest fires, however, as the debris would rain down over a long period, it would probably take pretty large impacts on the moon to cause acute effects on Earth. Though nuclear winter can happen regardless of the duration over which impacts occur.

yf22zc,https://www.reddit.com/user/ladiesluck,-1,"This is an intriguing question! Of course, the type of impact would depend on the answer. The Earth’s moon is actually a very large one proportionately to the Earth itself. Not as much as Pluto and it’s moon, Charon, which practically orbit each other, but the Moon’s orbit certainly affects our own. Throwing off this orbital balance, either by impacting the moon and cause detrimental damage or complete destruction, at the least, Earth’s orbit would be severely affected, I believe. This could cause even its orbit around the Sun to be affected, and therefore how it orbits and rotates in general, definitely affecting life. That’s not considering if pieces of the, or the entire, moon did not project towards earth. Then the original statement stands, we are basically in the first scenario with the asteroid impact.
Now, Mars is also interesting, but this would potentially be even larger scale. It’s probably safe to assume that if Mars were impacted and either broken off pieces or demolished, that those remains would not come towards Earth. Space is pretty big. But, gravitationally? Mars being hit and destroyed would affect the entire solar system, throwing it into chaos and more than likely throwing another planet or all out of it. This would of course affect Earth, even if the best case is that Earth’s orbit has changed and it is closer/further from the sun or in a chaotic/extremely ellipsied orbit. If Mars is only hit, and not destroyed, then this would probably be the best case scenario as far as life on Earth is concerned. This would potentially not really affect Earth nearly as much as the other options mentioned, in my opinion.

ykgpi3,https://www.reddit.com/user/iayork,1552,"Probably not.  As of 2017, the estimate was that about 20% of the Neanderthal genome is still extant, spread among modern humans.  

In the Science study, Akey and Benjamin Vernot, both of the University of Washington in Seattle, used similar statistical features to search for Neanderthal DNA in the genomes of 665 living people—but they initially did so without the Neanderthal genome as a reference. They still managed to identify fragments that collectively amount to 20 percent of the full Neanderthal genome.

--Surprise! 20 Percent of Neanderthal Genome Lives On in Modern Humans, Scientists Find
That's probably a floor rather than a ceiling, but even if they missed a lot it's hard to imagine more than 50% of the Neanderthal genome still being around.
In particular, it seems pretty likely that male human/Neanderthal hybrids were sterile (as often happens with interspecies hybrids), so there's a significant chunk of genome, the Y chromosome, missing altogether. 

Genes that are more highly expressed in testes than in any other tissue are especially reduced in Neanderthal ancestry, and there is an approximately fivefold reduction of Neanderthal ancestry on the X chromosome, which is known from studies of diverse species to be especially dense in male hybrid sterility genes. These results suggest that part of the explanation for genomic regions of reduced Neanderthal ancestry is Neanderthal alleles that caused decreased fertility in males when moved to a modern human genetic background.

--The landscape of Neandertal ancestry in present-day humans

Finally, the reduction of both archaic ancestries is especially pronounced on chromosome X and near genes more highly expressed in testes than other tissues (p = 1.2 × 10(-7) to 3.2 × 10(-7) for Denisovan and 2.2 × 10(-3) to 2.9 × 10(-3) for Neanderthal ancestry even after controlling for differences in level of selective constraint across gene classes). This suggests that reduced male fertility may be a general feature of mixtures of human populations diverged by >500,000 years.

ykgpi3,https://www.reddit.com/user/regular_modern_girl,178,"Most likely no, because while a substantial portion of the genomes of many modern humans are thought to be of Neanderthal origin, it’s not even close to enough. 
Considering there are some human populations (indigenous Australians, Melanesians, and I believe some small populations in Indonesia) that appear to have as much as 6% DNA of specifically Denisovan origin, it would actually be theoretically easier to do this with a Denisovan (and we’d arguably learn a lot more, considering we have yet to even find an intact skull from their species), but even then I’m assuming still almost certainly impossible; there’s not going to be even 50% of the genome of either of these extinct hominids left in any modern human, and probably much less than that ,
even with Denisovans.
Now, if we’re not talking selective breeding here but some kind of “Chickenosaurus”-esque tweaking of Homo sapiens genomes to make genes into more Neanderthal or Denisovan-like versions, that’s probably possible, but almost certainly never going to happen, considering all the glaring bioethics questions that it would bring up (besides how taboo tampering with human DNA on anywhere near that level is just in general, we’d also be bringing back an approximation of a most likely sapient species that, by most present estimations, were really very close to us in more respects than not, and those individuals who basically came into existence as nothing more than a questionable science experiment would probably never get to live anything resembling normal lives, would be alienated from the entire human population, would have no one else like them to relate to on a basic level, etc.). Tbh, the “Chickenosaurus Project” itself is just modifying chickens to be more like non-avian dinosaurs, and it’s been controversial enough even just doing that, I can’t even imagine what it would be like if someone announced this with an extinct human species.

It would require a pretty substantial team and the kind of resources only an academic research institution, government, or possibly extremely rich individual (but with that last one we’re probably talking like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos-level finances to be able to be able to realistically bankroll something of this magnitude) could really provide. Having a whole team on board would greatly increase the chances that someone would eventually blow the whistle on the whole thing. You also have to consider that there would likely be a fairly high rate of failure, which considering we’re talking about a human subject here (even if one who’s genetically not entirely an anatomically-modern human), that’s going to generate a lot of controversy even among the people working on the whole thing internally. Like the entire project would probably be substantially harder to pull off in every way even than cloning a human would be, and the latter has yet to actually occur you’ll notice (even despite the occasional fringe group who have shown some interest in doing so, such as the Raelian movement). I’m sure there are people deranged enough to want to do it, but I’m doubtful any of them actually have what it would take to even begin to effectively pull it off with current technology.
Also, worth noting that even the aforementioned “Chickenosaurus” has turned into something of the biotechnological equivalent of vaporware, as Jack Horner (the paleontologist eccentric enough to actually think it’s a good idea) has been promising that they’re nearly to the phase of having actual dinosaur-chickens hatching for several years now without many actual updates on progress, the whole thing has run into some financial issues from what I’ve heard, and frankly just reactivating a few atavistic traits in a domestic chicken genome is pretty rudimentary in comparison to what would be needed to realistically recreate a Neanderthal or Denisovan from a modern human (maybe if you were content just genetically- modifying a person to have a somewhat more Neanderthal-like skull or something, that would be doable, but I doubt the effect would even be particularly spectacular, seeing as how a lot of more recent reconstructions of how Neanderthals would’ve looked in life has them looking scarcely that different from modern Homo sapiens anyway).
EDIT: also there’s been talk of doing something similar by turning a modern Asiatic elephant into a mammoth, or at least an approximation, for literal decades now, and again we’re always somehow just “10 years away” from it happening. I’d expect we’d see a reconstructed mammoth quite some time before we’d ever see a reconstructed Neanderthal (and I’m increasingly skeptical we’ll ever see either, tbh).

By using lots of short, damaged, overlapping fragments and software to identify damage we already have several high coverage neandertal genomes. it may be possible one day to use these as a guide and change a modern human genome into a neandertal genome (I think this is the plan with the mammoth), which may be easier than ""manufacturing"" chromosome-length DNA strands (unless we see some major technology changes). 
Pulling out old damaged DNA fragments and ""patching them up"" is probably the least efficient and most error prone approach, and would need a lot of new technology. Easier to start from a 99.7% similar genome and just change the 0.3%, which sounds like not much but is still about 90 million changes! 
Most of these changes likely have no effect, so I think with the mammoth, they are trying to identify the changes behind key traits and making only these changes to the Asian elephant genome, rather than all of the ~120 million differences between mammoth and elephant. So this won't be a 100% mammoth, but should look more like one.

If I remember correctly having dna with short telomeres makes every other cell also have chromosomes with short telomeres since you cant just add telomeres (except ofc if you somehow use telomerase which often results in cancer and tbh not a reproduction engineer/specialist). We believe that the vanishing of telomeres is one of the symptoms or maybe even causes of aging. So somebody wo was cloned through the nucleus of a 30 yrs old has a short overall life expectancy

Genes are very odd though - having a similar gene doesn't always mean the gene expresses in the same way (the proteins that build you as a person can be very different). This is basically the origin of the popular idea that a human and banana share about 40% of their genetic makeup. We might share the genes, and much of what we do is the same, but what is similar also tends to express differently.
Similarly, we share a 90% genetic makeup with cats. Despite this we appear to be almost entirely different until you really understand how genes work.
Will acknowledge that when you're getting into the 98-99th percentile range, you would be expecting to see very few differences though.

yk1k2n,https://www.reddit.com/user/BebopFlow,2062,"I'm a massage therapist. Knot is really a catch-all with no definition, which causes a lot of confusion. A person is often referring to the phenomena of trigger points, but the plain truth is that very few people who have ""knots"" have trigger points in my experience. There's a distinct texture to a trigger point and pattern of response, and the method to release a trigger point is different from what you'd use on generalized muscle tightness. In most cases people that come to me complaining of knots just have a generalized muscle tightness caused by poor posture exacerbated by either lack of movement or lack of movement variety. I see 2-3 dozen or so new clients a month, outside of my regulars, and I'd say that I encounter a proper trigger point maybe twice a month on average or less. My specialty is in myofascial massage utilizing structural integration techniques and philosphy, so it would stand to reason that I'd be more likely to encounter people with trigger points since they'd self select, right? (Structural integration is a somewhat broad subset of myofascial massage with the intent of balancing the relative tension between muscular groups in order to relieve pain or increase range of motion, usually through utilization of targeted stretching, active/passive mobilization, and targeted deep tissue work)
Personally, I think the word knot is overused, to the detriment of people's health. What is implied when a professional uses the word knot is that there's something wrong, some sort of physical thing that needs to be untangled by someone else (or even worse, something that just is an aspect of you, like the color of your skin or your height) instead of a temporary state of affairs that can be improved by yourself. Especially when it's actually just general muscle tightness. A professional can help short term, but generally targeted stretching and exercise, with some mild lifestyle changes, is the cure. A person sitting at a computer 6-8 hours a day doesn't need someone to hammer their upper back/shoulders with their elbow (though it will feel good and provide short term relief), they need to sit still for shorter periods, stretch their pec minor, and do some band pull aparts/face pulls/rows/lat pulldowns.

A shortlist of stuff that could help includes exercise, massage (self-massage too), stretching, heat, dry needling or acupuncture. A portion of how much a particular therapy might help can be attributed to your interaction with the practitioner and your personal beliefs around that therapy (see biopsychosocial model of pain). Stress relief, adequate sleep, and improving general health (physical and psychological) can also contribute.

yk1k2n,https://www.reddit.com/user/bubbablake,3,"From personal experience, I had a knot in my back that would just “knot” go away. Some days it would be worse than others but it was always there.
Eventually, I sought treatment for it which consisted of physical therapy to strengthen surrounding muscles. This was done in hopes to relieve the work load of the muscle that had pain. The physical therapy definitely increased my range of mobility but it didn’t seem to help with the knot. 
Before I moved away from the individual that was helping me with the physical therapy, they offered to try dry needling. Basically they take one needle and stick it into the affected muscle and wiggle it around to cause the muscle to spasm and loosen up. It took a few tries where they would stick the needle in and move it around and I would tell them to go up or go over until they finally hit the right spot. 
Oh. My. Gosh. 
The sense of relief that I felt once they hit the right spot was amazing. There was still some soreness in the area afterwards but nothing like I was experiencing before. It took a few days for the muscle soreness to go away and then I was good to go. The knot didn’t come back.
I wouldn’t do this for every minor backache or knot but if I have one that lasts for a long time again, I would definitely do it if I had the chance. There are safety concerns associated with it though. The one I remember was that they had to check your breathing afterwards to make sure they didn’t poke into your lung. Also, I don’t think it’s legal in all US states after taking a quick look online.

Take a look at the work from Dr. Andreo Spina, he has a lot of traction in the rehab and elite performance communities. He talks about how strength is joint angle specific, many people don’t have strength through their whole range of flexibility which leaves them open to acute and s chronic injury and immobility.

Ive had a knot in my back for like 6+years now that wont go away no matter who I go see and what I do.

Just a stab in the dark, but is it just between your shoulder blade and your spine?  Possibly on the same side as your mouse hand?  Or, possibly on the same side as an arm you extend out straight when you're sleeping?
If so, I struggled with this for many years and discovered that having your arm extended apparently puts stress on that specific muscle.  The two situations I mentioned above were my triggers.  I would have my arm more or less extended in front of me to operate my mouse all day and would sleep on my side with my arm extended in front of me at night.
The permanent resolution for me (and my partner who was having identical problems) was to ensure I keep my elbow by my side when using my mouse.  Do NOT extend your arm.
The same rule applies during sleep.  It may feel nice to have your arm straight out, possibly wrapped around a pillow or a partner but you're going to regret it in the morning.
If what I've described is the case, try keeping your elbow next to your ribcage at all times when typing/mousing and not sleeping with your arm extended at night for a week.  You'll be surprised at how much better your back is.
Here's hoping for some relief for you.

More info:

A Trigger Point (TrP) is a hyperirritable spot, a palpable nodule in the taut bands of the skeletal muscles' fascia. Direct compression or muscle contraction can elicit jump sign, local tenderness, local twitch response and referred pain which usually responds with a pain pattern distant from the spot[1][2][3][4]. 

[...]

Anatomy and Etiology
Trigger points develop in the myofascia, mainly in the center of a muscle belly where the motor endplate enters (primary or central TrPs)[5]. Those are palpable nodules within the tight muscle at the size of 2-10 mm and can demonstrate at different places in any skeletal muscles of the body. We all have TrPs in the body. Can be present even in babies and children, but their presence does not necessarily result in the formation of pain syndrome. When it happens, TrPs are directly associated with myofascial pain syndrome*, somatic dysfunction, psychological disturbance and restricted daily functioning[7]. 

[...]

Causes - Usually, TrPs happen due to: 
*Ageing,
*Injury sustained by a fall, by stress or birth trauma.
*Lack of exercise - commonly in sedentary persons between 27,5-55 years, of which 45% are men[9],
*Bad posture - upper and lower crossed pattern, swayback posture, telephone posture, cross-legged sitting,
*Muscle overuse and respective micro-trauma - weightlifting,
*Chronic stress condition - anxiety, depression, psychological stress trauma,
*Vitamin deficiencies - vitamin C, D, B; folic acid; iron;
*Sleep disturbance,
*Joint problems and hypermobility.
Pathogenesis and Theories
Little is known about the formation of TrPs. There are some theories written in literature who try to explain the formation, sensitization, and manifestation of TrPs, but few of them have strong evidence[3][10][11].
Under normal conditions, pain from TrPs is mediated by thin myelinated (Ad) fibers and unmyelinated (C) fibers. Various noxious and innocuous events, such as mechanical stimuli or chemical mediators, may excite and sensitize Ad fibers and C fibers and thereby play a role in the development of TrPs.
Integrated Trigger Point Hypothesis (ITPH) is the present working hypothesis. When sarcomeres and motor endplate become overactive for a number of different reasons, pathological changes start at cellular levels. This turns on permanently sarcomeres leading to a local inflammatory response, loss of oxygen supply, loss of nutrient supply, endogenous (involuntary) shortening of muscle fibers, and increased metabolic demand on local tissues.
Electrophysiological investigations of TrPs reveals phenomena which indicate that the electrical activity arises from dysfunctional extrafusal motor endplates rather than from muscle spindles[12].
Polymodal theory explains the existence of polymodal receptors (PMRs) throughout the body which under certain constant, pathological stimuli turn into trigger points[13].
Radiculopathic theory explains direct relationship between problems on nerve roots which lead to local and distant neurovascular signals and trigger points creation[14].
Peripheral and Central Sensitization - Central sensitization is a phenomenon, together with peripheral sensitization, which helps in understanding chronic or amplified pain. There is central sensitization after an intense or repetitive stimulus of the nociceptor present in the periphery, leading to a reversible increase of excitability and of the synaptic efficacy of central nociceptive pathway neurons. Manifested as hypersensitivity to pain (called tactile allodynia and hyperalgesia secondary to puncture or pressure). These CNS changes may be detected by electrophysiological or imaging techniques[15][16].

So your question sort of boils down to ""why are some stars high-mass, and some low-mass""? This is a long-standing question in astrophysics, and we still don't have a complete answer. Stars form from collapsing gas clouds that become more dense due to gravity, until they become hot enough in their cores to start fusing hydrogen. The densest parts of the clouds collapse faster, so they fragment into smaller clouds, which become stars. The final mass distribution is set by a lot of different processes like turbulence, radiation pressure from stars that have already formed, and other factors we don't completely understand.

yqgxw4,https://www.reddit.com/user/KE_astro,94,"There are actually several different kinds of supernovae. You probably mean core-collapse supernovae of massive stars. In these, the core of the star collapses into a neutron star (and eventually perhaps a black hole) in a few tenths of a second. However, you wouldn't see anything at this point -- the stars that typically explode as supernovae are red sugergiants, which are huge -- their radius is about the size of Jupiter's orbit around the Sun! So unless you're inside the star, it will take a long time for the information that anything has happened to reach you.

​
The first thing you would notice, around 15:30 or so, would be a huge burst of neutrinos. These stream away from the core of the star at (almost) the speed of light, unimpeded by the outer layers of the star. This would be close to a lethal dose of radiation (https://what-if.xkcd.com/73/), but the outside of the star should still look completely normal.

​
Meanwhile, a shock is propagating through the inside of the star at a few tens of thousands of kilometers per second. Sometime on Thursday, this gets to the surface. That would be the first obvious evidence that anything funny was going on. And then shortly after that, you die.

​
There's also another kind of supernova that comes from the merger of binary white dwarfs (""type Ia"" supernovae). White dwarfs are much smaller than red supergiants (about the size of the Earth), so there the entire explosion would be visible within a few seconds.

",0,0,True,False,True,1.0,33.0,1667580499.0,32.0
yqgxw4,https://www.reddit.com/user/KE_astro,55,"V Puppis is unlikely to contain a black hole. The visible object in V Puppis is an eclipsing binary containing two normal stars. The eclipses are not exactly periodic, however -- sometimes they come earlier than expected, and sometimes later. A paper in 2008 found that the residuals of the eclipse times (compared to what's expected with no variation) are roughly sinusoidal. One way to explain this is by positing that the system is a triple, with a massive unseen companion. In that case, the eclipses would come later when the close binary is on the far side of its orbit around the 3rd object (due to a longer light travel time to Earth), and earlier when it's on the closer side. That's what was proposed in the discovery paper: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...687..466Q/abstract

​
The problem with this hypothesis is that there are other things that can cause eclipse timing variations, including apsidal motion, magnetic cycles, angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking and gravitational waves, and various combinations of these. As reviewed in this paper https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.5725P/abstract, there is a long history of people claiming to detect third bodies around eclipsing binaries due to eclipse timing variations, only to find that the variations are no longer well-fit by a triple model after a few more years. Some tertiaries definitely are detected this way, but it's not a foolproof method.

​
Besides V Puppis, there are a bunch of other eclipsing binaries that have been claimed to have distance black hole companions, e.g.
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.2804W/abstract
, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PASJ...71...66T/abstract
, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...871L..10E/abstract
, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.405.1930L/abstract

​
Note that there is a fair amount of overlap between the author lists of these papers (and the V Puppis paper). I would say most of the community doesn't believe these claims partly due to the issues listed above, and partly because it would be weird if the occurrence rate of black hole companions were much higher around eclipsing binaries than around single stars.

​
As for V Puppis in particular, that system was studied again in 2021 by this paper: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.6032B/abstract. Have a look in particular at Section 5. The model fit by Qian et al. (who claimed there was a BH) in 2008 does a good job of describing the data until 2008, and begins to do poorly immediately afterward. This is a classic sign of overfitting. So, long story short, there is probably no black hole in V Puppis.

The BH is (probably) losing mass by Hawking radiation, but it's also probably gaining mass by accretion of the Sun-like star's stellar wind. The expected mass loss from Hawking radiation is about 10^{-70} solar masses per year (tiny tiny tiny), and the wind accretion rate is something like 10^{-18} solar masses per year (tiny tiny), so the accretion wins.   
Are wormholes theoretically possible?  sure, probably. But we don't know of any astrophysical process that makes them, and we don't really know what they should look like, so it will probably be a while before we (or at least I) can say anything intelligent about detecting them!

yqgxw4,https://www.reddit.com/user/KE_astro,35,"About HR 6819: I actually wrote a paper about a month after the discovery paper arguing that that system doesn't contain a black hole at all: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.3436E/abstract 
In short, the bright star in that system is in a short-lived phase of binary evolution where it ""looks"" (based on its temperature and luminosity) much more massive than it actually is. It looks like a ~6 solar mass star, but it's really only ~0.6 solar masses, because most of its mass has recently been transferred to its binary companion. When you account for the lower mass of the bright star, the dynamically-implied mass of its companion also goes down a lot, and instead of being a black hole, it's consistent within another luminous star. 
This model was recently tested independently by another group (including the first author of the paper claiming it was a BH), and now everyone agrees there's not BH. See: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2204/ 
About the Unicorn: similar story. I wrote a paper earlier this year (together with the first author of the paper claiming it was a BH) showing that it's a mass transfer binary with two luminous stars. https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.5620E/abstract 
In short, it's a rough environment out there for claimed nearest BHs! But we've learned a lot about binary star evolution from these false positives. Gaia BH1 is a fairly different kind of system -- our inference that the unseen companion is a BH doesn't depend on any assumptions about the mass or evolutionary state of the luminous star.

yqgxw4,https://www.reddit.com/user/anghelfilon,12,"Oh, I have several questions if you don't mind:
1) 
So this black hole's event horizon is 30Km, but the singularity itself is as far as we know infinitesimally small, correct? But that is also correct for a the largest black hole. How can a small black hole be the size of a point, but also one 1000 times larger is also the size of a point? Is the point somehow larger or is the matter going down the singularity going somewhere? Is there a way to visualize this?
2) Or does the math simply say infinity and 1000x infinity is also infinity?
How does a black hole ""communicate"" its mass to the Universe outside its event horizon? From what I understand, in quantum physics we are looking for a particle that would play the role of communicating mass (the graviton), but how could such a particle escape the event horizon? Also on that note, my understanding is that gravity ""travels"" at the speed of light (as in, if our Sun suddenly disappeared, the Earth would feel its absence after 499 seconds). So again, if gravity travels at the speed of light, but light can't escape a black hole, how come gravity can escape a black hole and make its presence felt even outside the event horizon?
​
3) 
If there are two black holes, A and B. A is static (or close to static) and B is significantly more massive than A and travelling very very fast with respect to A and passes through A's event horizon, could it exit A's event horizon? Or would it just drag A along with it, containing A within the radius of A's event horizon? Or something else?

yqgxw4,https://www.reddit.com/user/KE_astro,17,"(1) Yes, formally general relative predicts that all BHs reach infinite density in their centers. However, because we don't have a unified theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics, it's not clear whether this actually happens in nature, or is just evidence of our incomplete theory. The event horizon permanently shields whatever is happening at the center of the BH from the outside world and our observations, so we can only speculate.  
(2) Gravitons -- assuming they exist -- follow null geodesics just like photons, and thus cannot pass outward through the event horizon. But the gravity at a point in space is a result not of the gravitons, but of the energy density and curvature of space. If this sounds unsatisfying, it basically reflects -- as (1) does -- that we don't have a unified theory of GR and QM. Here's some further discussion (I confess I'm not expert here either): http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/89-the-universe/black-holes-and-quasars/theoretical-questions/451-how-do-gravitons-escape-black-holes-to-tell-the-universe-about-their-gravity-advanced

Secondly, I only have more questions now that you've answered! (I guess that's a good thing)
2) It sounds as if the virtual gravitons would be able to go superluminal, but at the same time gravity would move at the speed of light. Let's say you are in a ship capable of turning instantly... So if you're heading towards a singularity towards its very center at 0.99c and just as you cross the event horizon, the singularity disappears from the Universe and at the same time you instantly reverse and head the other way, what would happen? Would you still fall towards the ex-singularity at c speed until the gravity wave would hit you at 1/2 event horizon radius and ""tell"" you that there's nothing pulling you anymore so you can now reverse OR would you instantly be able to reverse at the event horizon?
3) The question was if B would be able to escape A's event horizon or if it is just that A can't escape B's event horizon and is dragged along B's path? For extreme differences, let's say A is a micro-black hole with an event horizon of 1cm in radius, a super massive black hole would technically still be a point and could fit in A's event horizon, would B.... a supermassive BH travelling at say 0.8c not be able to cross that 1-2cm and be pulled back? And yes, I realize that A would also start to get attracted to B when B gets close enough, but the questions is I guess the more I think about it.... is there no path where A would indeed fall towards B as B is hurtling towards A such that A would not hit B head on, but rather B would barely scrape by A at less than 1cm and then B would also cross into A's event horizon (which is going in the opposite direction of B) and be unable to escape A's event horizon?
Sorry for the complicated write-up, hope it's somehow intelligible.

Another is that a bunch of stellar mass BHs in dense clusters can merge to form intermediate-mass (and eventually, supermassive) BHs.

yqgxw4,https://www.reddit.com/user/KE_astro,8,"I've liked science since I was a kid, but I started college as a philosophy major. I only switched to astrophysics after a couple years. There were many reasons I switched, but here's one: I met with my undergrad research advisor, who asked what I liked about philosophy. I said something along the lines of, ""well, I think it's really cool that we are asking fundamental questions about the human experience -- the same questions people were asking 2000 years ago"". Her response was something like ""huh. In physics, if we worked on a question for 2000 years and didn't make any progress, we'd move to a different question!"" So what I like about science is that we can not just ask -- but also answer -- fundamental questions. In astrophysics, there is so much we don't know that the barrier of entry is pretty small -- there are lots of unanswered questions that a graduate student can think about for a few months and make real progress on.

What kept me in science: a combination of excellent mentors, exciting new datasets to work with, and good luck!

I actually started grad school working in a completely different field, running cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. That was fun too, but I switched to binary stars and BHs after a few years because there has been an explosion of new data in the field in the last few years thanks to mission like Gaia, so there's no shortage of open questions to work on.

That being said, Planet 9 is unlikely to be primordial black hole, for several reasons:
- We have no evidence that primordial black holes exist,
- We have only modest evidence that planet 9 exists
- If planet 9 exists, its existence can be pretty well explained by classes of objects we know exist: planets! These make for a simpler explanation than a hypothetical class of object that may not exist at all.
You may have heard that primordial black holes are a dark matter candidate, and thus think it's natural to have them also explain planet 9 (two birds, one stone). But it's actually not possible for black holes with masses similar to the hypothesized planet 9 (~5-10 Earth masses, or ~10^-5 Msun) to make up most of the dark matter. See Figure 12 of this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12778. Black holes (or any massive object) of that cannot contribute more than ~5% of the dark matter, as they would have been detected by gravitational microlensing experiments.

In some cases, there is probably a supernovae, and the black hole gets a ""kick"" in a random direction at something like 100 km/s. In others, the star probably collapses peacefully.   
(2) Yes. The nearest massive star that will foreseeably become a BH is about 400 light years away. The lifetime of such massive stars is about 10 million years, or about 1/1000 of the age of the Milky Way. So there should be about 1000 times more BHs than massive stars.

yqgxw4,https://www.reddit.com/user/KE_astro,1,"YeahYes, many people have wondered if black holes could solve the dark matter problem. Systems like Gaia BH1 cannot solve it, simply because they're are too rare. In Gaia BH1, the total binary mass is indeed ~10 times higher than the visible mass, so if every star were like Gaia BH1, we could more than solve the dark matter problem. But most stars *don't* have black hole companions like this -- we had to look at millions of stars before we found one that did!
 
Of course, it's possible that the other BHs are just in really long- period binary orbits, or are just not in binaries at all. Indeed, it probably *is* true that isolated BHs vastly outnumber those in binaries, and we think the total mass of all the BHs in the Milky way is in the neighborhood of a billion solar masses -- of order 1% of all the mass in stars. That's still not enough to account for most of the dark matter. Two different kinds of investigations have shown that most of the dark matter can't be stellar black holes:
 
(a) microlensing experiments like OGLE, MACHO, and EROS: these basically stare at background stars that are far away (i.e., near the center of the Milky Way, or in satellite galaxies) for a long time and see how often they suddenly get brighter due to gravitational microlensing. If the Milky Way halo were chock full of BHs, microlensing events would occur frequently. The are indeed observed to occur -- in most cases, due to stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, and probably the occasional BH, but the don't occur often enough for BHs to make up a dominant fraction of the dark matter.

(b) wide binaries: the Milky Way contains a lot of barely-bound wide binaries containing normal stars separated by distances of order 100,000 times the Earth-Sun distance. If the galaxy were full of black holes, the widest binaries wouldn't live long, because perturbations from all the black holes would quickly disrupt them. Yet, the wide binaries live.

​
Probably not. JWST is (mostly) good for looking at things that are very faint or very red. This star is pretty bright and yellow, so it's not clear what we'd be able to do with JWST. The main problem is that in the optical and infrared, any light coming from the BH (due to accretion of the stellar wind) is outshone -- by something like a factor of a million -- by the bright star. The angular resolution of JWST is too low (by a factor of ~30) to resolve the star and BH, even if the BH were producing light JWST could see. 
​
One thing we could do with JWST is continue to measure the luminous star's wobble, by looking at it every few weeks monitoring how it moves relative to background stars. This would tighten our constraints on the orbit and black hole mass somewhat. But Gaia is collecting this data anyway, for free, so it's unlikely the JWST allocation committee would approve this proposal just so we don't have to wait ~3 years until the next Gaia data release. 
​
More interesting than JWST would be Chandra (X-ray) and VLA (radio), because BHs tend to be much brighter at these wavelengths than stars. So if we detect anything, we can be fairly confident it's actually coming from the BH.

yqgxw4,https://www.reddit.com/user/MarcusMacG,1,"I have a question that is a little strange. Let's start by putting Mars at the Jupiter-Sun L5 point.
Let's see what happens.

Mars stays at the L5 point indefinitely until it gets knocked off the equilibrium point
Mars gets attracted to Jupiter
It tends to miss and loops around the outside in a parabola
It flies away from Jupiter and runs out of velocity around 4.8 AU
It orbits the Sun in a highly parabolic manner, crossing the orbits of the inner planets 
It has the right energy, so to get to its current orbit you just have to choose the right impact parameter
The impact parameter you would need for Mercury or Venus is less than their radius, ruling them out.
So Mars flew by Earth at an extremely low altitude to get to where it is now.

So this trajectory makes three predictions: Holes in Mars, torn from it when passing Jupiter. A giant bulge taking up a quarter of the surface of Mars from passing Earth. A 15,000 km long strip of raised terrain on Earth. These are some bizarre predictions and yet they are all clearly visible. They are so clear that I do not feel the need to name them.
Now I have a whole bunch of questions. When you were a child did you dream that being a scientist is like fighting for truth and knowledge? How much would it take to give up that dream? How much do scientists make? Do you find your work fulfilling? But alas I have only one question so I'm going to choose this one.  
Let's say I am a time traveller travelling to pre-apocalyptic Earth with the concept of tweaking their science in order to minimise the damage. My plan was just to whisper hints. That did not work. Tell them directly? Nope. Submit for publication? Nope. Public spectacle? Nope. So my question is 'If you were a time traveller trying to advance science how would you go about it?'
As an addendum, do you know why I can't seem to change the timeline? We suspect it is a cultural phenomenon that we do not understand.

yqgxw4,https://www.reddit.com/user/KE_astro,1,"Yes, many people have wondered if black holes could solve the dark matter problem. Systems like Gaia BH1 cannot solve it, simply because they are too rare. In Gaia BH1, the total binary mass is indeed ~10 times higher than the visible mass, so if every star were like Gaia BH1, we could more than solve the dark matter problem. But most stars *don't* have black hole companions like this -- we had to look at millions of stars before we found one that did!
Of course, it's possible that the other BHs are just in really long period binary orbits, or are just not in binaries at all. Indeed, it probably *is* true that isolated BHs vastly outnumber those in binaries, and we think the total mass of all the BHs in the Milky way is in the neighborhood of a billion solar masses -- of order 1% of all the mass in stars. That's still not enough to account for most of the dark matter. Two different kinds of investigations have shown that most of the dark matter can't be stellar black holes:
(a) microlensing experiments like OGLE, MACHO, and EROS: these basically stare at background stars that are far away (i.e., near the center of the Milky Way, or in satellite galaxies) for a long time and see how often they suddenly get brighter due to gravitational microlensing. If the Milky Way halo were chock full of BHs, microlensing events would occur frequently. The are indeed observed to occur -- in most cases, due to stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, and probably the occasional BH, but the don't occur often enough for BHs to make up a dominant fraction of the dark matter.
(b) wide binaries: the Milky Way contains a lot of barely-bound wide binaries containing normal stars separated by distances of order 100,000 times the Earth-Sun distance. If the galaxy were full of black holes, the widest binaries wouldn't live long, because perturbations from all the black holes would quickly disrupt them. Yet, the wide binaries live.

yqgxw4,https://www.reddit.com/user/withsoapandskin,1,"I am endlessly fascinated by space, and in another lifetime, one where I’m not scared of my own shadow, I’d have loved to be an astronaut pioneering space exploration. I am entranced by the beauty of black holes and the mysteries that surround them. 

Maybe this is a silly question, but theoretically, do you think it could ever be possible to see the inside of a black hole? Do have speculations or beliefs on what may reside within them (if anything is even truly in there)? Furthermore, do you think humans have the capability to interstellar travel or is that sort of a pipe dream? 
Another area of fascination is time and time relativity. I know gravity effects time and the stronger the gravitational pull the slower the clock moves. Does this mean without gravity time would cease to exist? The two seem to be interconnected with one another. So how does one exist without the other is my thought process. 
Also, when a Star explodes light years away do scientists know about it relatively right away? Or, could we be looking at stars in the night sky that died long ago, but the speed of light had still not yet reached us? 

Sorry for all the questions! Once upon a time I wanted to be just like you, but I hate math so that never panned out very far lol. Thanks for taking the time to respond to everyone’s questions! I’m not sure if you’ll get to mine, but if you do I’m very eager to hear your response!

Sag A* in the galactic center has a mass of about 4 million solar masses, and a radius of about 10 million km. It's actually pretty small and low-mass compared to the rest of the Galaxy -- I.e., it's only dynamically important in the very center.

We know that pterosaurs and dinosaurs shared a common ancestor over 240 million years ago. Pterosaurs, theropod dinosaurs, and ornithischian dinosaurs have been discovered with downy feather-like covering.
If we assume their common ancestor ALSO had that covering, downy feathers would originated over 240 million years ago. HOWEVER, it is possible that this feature showed up independently in each of these lineages, so it depends on your initial model. Do you assume the presence of a structure in related lineages originated with their common ancestor? Or is there evidence that it could have originated independently (e.g., structural differences in the anatomy of the feathers)?
Right now, I'd wager that feathers showed up around 240 million years ago in that common ancestor, but I'm certainly open to the possibility of multiple origins too.

They discovered that an extinct food web has rewired itself with modern animals! During the last Ice Age, Smilodon (sabertooth cats) would hunt horses that were once native to North America. As Smildon hunted these horses, the horses would avoid certain areas and in those areas, plants would grow a lot better! Today, both Smilodon and native horses are extinct in North America, BUT the mountain lion still lives! And now the mountain lion has been found to hunt invasive donkeys (not native to North America). The team of scientists found that the same predator-prey interactions between mountain lions and donkeys is causing plants to grow better in the areas where the lions hunt!

Museums get help for projects that they do not necessarily have the personnel or funds to take on themselves and seniors gain experience and employment. It's a total win/win!

A museum or university is going to want to know how much training will be provided by them versus how much you will provide. A clear hierarchy or chain of command regarding the individuals in your program would be a must as well. I would be hesitant to take on anyone in a lab I ran if it wasn't clear who was responsible for supervision of the individual whether it be the institution or the program.

In terms of proposing to a museum, to be straight with you, it would require a lot of logistical and financial planning. There are going to be a lot of liability red-tape you are going to have to deal with because larger institutions have policies in place that are not inclusive or equitable and only meant to protect their organization.

Some feathers leave a mark on the bone. Then we find animals with their feathers, skin, or hair preserved. Sometimes, the skin is so well preserved that we can determine size and organization of scales (or the lack of scales). We assume that closely related animals will have had similar skin/scale/feather patterns.
All whales and dolphins evolved from a land-dwelling ancestor. We have a series of fossil animals that show how, little by little, these ancestors changed their skeleton to become better at living in the water, where they did have few competitors for resources (after all, most of the large aquatic predators of the age of dinosaurs died out with them and left the oceans open for the taking). The changes to the skeleton and the physiology of whales and dolphins were so dramatic that they cannot live on land anymore (they are so heavy that they will suffocate laying on land, their skin is so sensitive that they get easily sunburned, they cannot walk around, they have special diets that they cannot pursue on land,  and the thick layer of fat that they have means that whales and dolphins easily overheat).
That is a great question... there are so many fossils all over the world that it is difficult to answer. For dinosaurs, the top spots might be China, Canada, the USA, Argentina, and the UK.
This might sound cheesy, but it is usually the next discovery. The joy of discovery never gets old and everything is memorable.
The group of primates that humans belong to has long and very mobile arms, that is why we do not need long and flexible tails. The arms let us do many great things, and over time our tails became shorter and shorter.

Yes! Sometimes fossils are preserved with the soft tissues as well, so we can see directly if there were feathers or scales, for example.
Dolphins didn't live on land exactly, but the ancestors of whales (including dolphins) was a small, deer-like animal with hoofs that lived on land. Whales are closely related to hippos, giraffes, deer, cows, camels, and other ""cloven-hoofed"" mammals (artiodactyls)!
I don't know the exact number for this, but in terms of vertebrate fossils, some hot spots with lots of fossils are China, Mongolia, Canada, the States, Argentina, and the UK. There are more that I'm missing!

ylvmau,https://www.reddit.com/user/jnestler,3,"Paleontology is a very broad field, so people can take many different paths. 
One of the things I love about it is that you don’t have to be a professional to be involved. There are lots of opportunities to volunteer at natural history museums, for example. Even just supporting your local museum is a huge help, and they often have special exhibits or presentations that are a great way to learn. 
As far as eduction goes, we generally get an undergraduate degree in biology or geology. I majored in environmental science and minored in zoology, so I took a bunch of both courses. For grad school, we’d look to work with an advisor in our area of interest. They often work in geology or biology departments, sometimes even medical schools. 
I would recommend focusing on building skills as a scientists that apply both to my research interests and also the broader job market. For example, I know how to code in R, and that has been a very useful skill. I also have a background in GIS and in relational databases. That was very helpful when I was looking at jobs outside academia. My job title isn’t “paleontologist” – but I use what I learned in my education every day, and I am still very much involved in the field. Having that flexibility has been great. Had I only considered being a professor or curator, I would have really limited myself.

Those seem like wildly different descriptions to me. I know we can take a lot of hints from fossils and extrapolate to the rest of the animal but how can we be so confident of what an animals life was like so long ago based off of one damaged fossil?
We were so wrong about Spinosaurus and Iguanadon (I know, not mammals) when first discovered compared to current day.
How often do we notice huge changes to mammalian descriptions based off new fossil discoveries? Should there be more caution in describing animals so comoletely with such few details considering how cultural images are difficult to change (see dinos with feathers)?

I know that using the word ""proto-mammals"" to describe synapsids and cynodonts is an inaccurate term, what do you call the animals before the first ""true"" mammals evolved? 
were multituberculates monotremes or did they give live birth, I read ""the rise and reign of mammals"" recently and I feel like that's never made super clear. Were all pre-therian mammals in the monotreme family or were there several different egg laying mammal families that have since gone extinct?
For each person that can reply, what fact do you think is most mind-blowing that you've learned based on your research or something in your field? It doesn't need to be shocking or extreme to anyone else but it still holds that child-like marvel element of wonder for you.

1. Ok, start by placing Mars at the Jupiter-Sun L5 point.
2. Mars will eventually falls towards Jupiter
3. Mars will miss, looping around on the outside in a parabola.
4. Mars runs out of velocity around 4.8 AU and orbits Sun very eccentrically
5. Mars has the right amount of energy and can get to its current orbit by the right choice of impact parameter.
6. Mercury and Venus cannot do it, their impact parameters are less than their radius.
7. So it would have to be Earth and Mars had to pass at an altitude of hundreds of kilometers.
This predicts three large things right off the bat. Giant holes in Mars from passing Jupiter. A giant bulge on Mars from passing Earth. A 15,000 km strip of raised terrain on Earth from Mars passing. 
As strange as these predictions are; we can see them all clearly. So clearly I don't think I even have to name them. Now the only rapid uplifting I know of is Lake Tanganika around 10,000 years ago, which is the right place. I assume similar uplifting events occurred all the way to Siberia. A massive worldwide disruption that took about 8 minutes  
So I guess I'm saying that Mars killed the megafauna. I can't be the first person to think of this. Have you ever heard of someone doing research about this? If no one has ever though of this; what do you think about it? The math involves may appear daunting, but it can be done without calculus. I recommend doing it

ydyf7q,https://www.reddit.com/user/kotoku,1,"While this is the primary reason for why water doesn't flow backwards (contaminating the public supply), the use of backflow preventers is also common (especially for large commercial draws or to prevent backflow in the case of breaks. This won't matter much because of the volume in comparison to the sanitized water in the line, but is especially helpful in municipalities that use ozone or other methods to sanitize rather than chlorine and maintain lower chlorine levels in the line typically.
Anyhow, backflow prevention:
When water enters your home from the main water supply line, it should only ever flow in one direction: into your home.
But sometimes, due to pressure changes in the pipes, that water can actually flow backwards and seep back into the main water supply line.
For example, backflow can happen when there’s a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines.
And when this happens, backflow can contaminate the public drinking supply with:
Fertilizers/pesticides
Human waste
Chlorine from pools/spas
Soap from sinks/dishwashers/showers
And that’s where a backflow prevention system comes in handy.
Backflow prevention systems are devices installed onto a pipe that only allow water to flow in one direction.
Think of it as a one-way gate that allows water from the city’s public water supply to flow into your home’s piping but stops water if and when it ever tries to flow backwards into the main water supply.

ydyf7q,https://www.reddit.com/user/PostPostModernism,69,"The situation can vary a lot depending on individual circumstances but it sounds like there's something wrong with your location. It could be a lot of things though. The municipality may not be providing water at high enough pressure for your area. There may be a leak somewhere that is drawing off pressure (though I think thats less likely since it would cause a lot of other problems that would be easier to spot). It could be a clogged line or fixture (more likely line if the entire 3rd floor is low pressure). It could be that the building system was under-designed to not let enough water in. 
If the municipality it providing proper pressure to the building then 3 stories shouldn't be nearly enough to lose pressure. 
Some buildings have a pump to constantly circulate water in the pipes to let the hot water be more readily available. They may also need a pump for taller buildings as each foot of vertical lift reduces pressure. Skyscrapers typically have a pump every 20-30 floors to re-pressurize the system as it goes up, or you can pump water to the top of the building and let gravity maintain pressure as it goes down. 
Buildings also often have pumps for ejecting storm water (sump pumps) or sewer waste (ejector pumps) if the sewer line is higher than the lowest bathroom level, or if it's too far away for the slopes to work underground. 
My point being is that there may be a lot of reasons for a pump and its hard to know why your condo is losing pressure without a more formal evaluation by an engineer.

ydyf7q,https://www.reddit.com/user/Dudge,22,"I would be skeptical of the pump supplying the pressure. The pump is not sufficient to the task of supplying water that far up, and would be hard pressed to modulate its own running speed to accomodate for every time a tap is turned on or off. 
Pumps for a building would typically be used to fill a tank on the roof of the building that would then source the water for the building below. Since the 3rd floor is closer to the level of the tank, there is less pressure available there. 
All water pressure is based on the differential between the level at th top of the water in the tank and the outlet which the water is exiting from.

I know some rural homes on wells use that system of small tanks and air pressure.  Your thinking is valid in principle, though!
The math on calculating water pressure is always the same; .434 psi/ft of depth. (they call it ""water column"")
Rule of thumb for quick calculations is 1/2 psi per foot.  It works for calculating pressure at depth or what pressure is required to pump water to a given height.  e.g. to pump water up a 10 story building you need about 60 psi at the base.  Assuming 12' per story, commercial buildings.

the pressure to the pipe going back into the system

There is no pipe going back into the system. No pumps (I'll tell you an exception). 
Imagine the main water service line being like a street full of vehicles, it is busy busy busy. One car turns off into a parking spot at a home. From up above, it makes little visual difference. 
That is the equivalent of someone drawing a bath. The street is still very very busy, and the water line still has plenty of pressurevolume. 
*The exception: Above the arctic circle, (at least in North America) the pipes are above ground, but insulated, and the main water line runs in a loop, the continual motion keeps it from freezing. Each home draws what it needs via a siphon. 
Sewage is the same, and each home has a pump that pumps the sewage out. This is different from warmer climates, where gravity flows sewage into increasingly deep (and larger) lines.

ydyf7q,https://www.reddit.com/user/Tools4toys,18,"Actually you do point out a typically municipal water system is also looped. There are often places where there are 2 separate lines supplying water to an area.  Non-looped branches may go off that main loop to supply one street or area, but if one main line on the loop suffers a break, that section may be closed off so not everyone is affected by the break.  They can shut off the section, repair and maintain service to say 80% of the community versus shutting off everyone.  In addition to failures, looping also maintains a more consistent pressure to branched locations, in the event of a break or a high usage situation, such as a firetruck drawing off water. At a minimum having a large volume of water in a looped system also helps to maintain the pressure.     
Modern day firetrucks can pump 1500 gallons per minute, which is probably more than most fire hydrants can supply. In our subdivision, which is 75 years old, the main line feeding our street is a 4"" main, at best it could supply is 250 gallons per minute.

Above the arctic circle, the pipes are above ground, but insulated, and the main water line runs in a loop, the continual motion keeps it from freezing.

Above the Arctic circle in Norway, Sweden and Finland, this isn't true in almost all cases. The norm here is underground piping, but insulated and/or with heating cables. Most houses and areas outside big cities have septic tanks instead of communal sewerage. Many people also have wells that can supply only their own household or even multiple neighbors. 
Too be fair ""big cities"" are probably a different definition up here as we have a much smaller populations compared to other countries. The three countries only have a population of about 21 million people together. And only around 1,1 million of those people live in the Arctic. In Sweden 30% of it's total land area is in the Arctic circle, but less than 5% of their population live there. About half of Norway's land area is above the circle, but only about 500 000 people live there. 
Unless there is permafrost. Most of the inhabitated parts in the Arctic region ( in Europe at least) doesn't have permafrost tho. Exceptions probably mainly being Russia, which has about 2 million people living in Arctic (or so google tells me anyways). But I don't know that much about how their plumbing setup is.
Source, I've lived my entire life above the Arctic circle in Scandinavia and have multiple people in my family that are plumbers. Many winters growing up we would be out of water, either because there wasn't enough water in the well for 3 houses, or the heating cables would stop working due to power outages in the middle of the winter and the piping would freeze and burst.. Having to take a 20 minutes car ride to shower isn't great. -1/10 would not recommend. My family had a new well drilled and haven't had a problem with the water since then lucky for us. It's super expensive tho, and we had to take up a loan to finance it :/

i was thinking maybe every house had a pump

This is why there are water towers, and why they're tall and/or built on high ground.  Gravity then feeds water to all the buildings and maintains the pressure.
The water tower itself will have a pump, but it runs 24 hours a day - during peak periods (mornings and evenings, when people are cooking and showering), water will be leaving the water tower faster than its being pumped back in, but the pump keeps ahead of usage during off-peak times (night, mid-day).

They pump the water up the tower, and that water reservoir provides water pressure for the hole town. Water comes out as fast as gravity can push it. If you live in a tall apartment building, you likely have a miniature water tower on the rooftop mechanical, that pumps water into it, and then gravity feeds the water into the units.
Valves are only so big, so water pressure is limited by the bottleneck there.
Those ""screen"" filtery things in faucets help to reduce turbulence in the water and limit the flow of water as well.

increase the pressure to the pipe going back into the system

This sounds like part of the misconception - water doesn't get passed back into the system. Well, it does, but into a separate system - the sewers - and the sewage system output pressure is completely decoupled from the supply system's input pressure. I.e. running sewage lines at high pressure won't do anything to the pressure of the clean water supply.
The water supply pipes coming into a house are all dead ends, that only flow when you open a faucet. There's no return path to inject water back into the city supply pipes.
Houses with wells or cisterns do use a pump, but that's because you're bringing up water from below (and moving water up always takes energy). But those houses almost exclusively are not connected to city water.

That's safety valve's job. It opens up if the pressure gets too high. 
The purpose of expansion tank is to even out the pressure differences.

Some water mains run 250psi on transmission, and pressures are reduced as it gets closer to the end user.

Nobody has 250psi on their waterlines, you get 60 on average. 250psi is unreal for a city main.

Say, for simplicity, a city uses 24 million gallons a day of water. Say the water plant can only produce 1 million gallons per hour. Water use isn’t even; huge flows are need in morning and evening. So how do we supply water when at 8am-9am the city needs 2 million gallons but can only produce 1 million? This is where towers help. The tower water level decreases and feeds the system a lot of water. It refills overnight. The plant chugs along steady overnight to replenish the towers while actual water usage by residents is low. Towers also have a big valve that shuts off when they get full. Otherwise it would overflow. Once it’s middle of the night and towers are full and shut, there’s nowhere for water to go. The pressure increases and the water plant computer detects this spike. It’s like inflating a balloon; once the water system aka balloon is full, the plant slows or stops until the pressure reaches a low enough level to begin pumping again. Without a human at the controls or a computer the system would blow apart pipes.

Testing of fire hydrants is standard practice unless the Utility has an incredibly well-calibrated and comprehensive hydraulic model (based on Hydrant testing, of course).   Hydrant testing is used to design building fire systems, booster pump systems for high rises, and determine water system characteristics (nc valves, c-factors, etc). Not to mention, actual fire flow has a lot to do with residual pressure and not just static system pressure.
Having very high system pressure (over 100 psi) is inefficient.  Pressure reducing valves burn off energy to bring pressure down (wasting the energy that was put into the water  in the first place).  Most households have 40-80 psi.  
Higher pressure also puts additional, unnecessary stress on pipe, joints, valves, hydrants, etc.  It also increases usage by literally pushing more water through a faucet, tap, or hydrant.
It's much easier to partition systems into zones and boost the pressure to required levels than it is to over-pressurize the entire system and reduce pressure at the various points-of-use.

Larger pipe equals more flow with less frictional loss.

So the answer is to slowly turn the water hydrant off?

How long is your piece of string? the general rule is that the older the valve / hydrant/ is the slower you turn.

ydyf7q,https://www.reddit.com/user/MowMdown,16,"Ok, so there have been a lot of wrong answers. Lets set the record straight.
Background: It's my job to flow hydrants and perform hydraulic calculations based on the flows and pressures I record. I do this so I can engineer fire suppression system and tell Fire Departments how much water and pressure they need to supply a building to fight fires.
How it works essentially is that there is so much water in the system that when you open your 1/2"" tap, you're getting supplied constant pressure due to the sheer volume of water that exists in the city water main. Think of a pinhole in a garden hose. You cannot exhaust enough water out of the garden hose to cause it to go flat.
We can also do the opposite too by creating a vacuum and cavitating the water lines by pulling too much water using pumps, I have to make sure we avoid this.
Typical the system has around 60psi without water flowing, once I open that hydrant up all the way, I'm now flowing 1000+ gallons per minute, this will often cause a pressure drop of 10-20psi depending on the system. 

if all that water is running under the city at a base pressure wouldnt a house opening the faucet decrease the pressure of the overall system?

When you open a tap in your house, you're drawing usually 3-5 gallons per minute roughly which might cause a 1psi drop in pressure for the whole system. Now if everyone on your block ran all their water, you would notice it.
Pressure is equal to the (flow rate x k-factor)2
K-Factor is equal to the (flow / sqrt(pressure))

how can every house receive the same water pressure at the same time

TL;DR pressure is constant with the exception of pipe friction. Pressure decrease the further downstream you go from the source however we can make pipe smaller to increase the pressure.

how are some parts of the system not more pressurised than other by use/un-use.

They are actually, but we regulate it to maintain a constant pressure using specific valves and pumps. We use pressure regulating valves to keep pressure under certain thresholds and we use booster pumps to boost pressure that is too far away from the source.

So if no one uses the water it goes in and comes out the other end, ensuring the system doesn't go over pressure and explode but always has available water that is pressurized.

Depending on which country you live in, there may be requirements that set minimum requirements to ensure water supply and quantity are adequate as the network expands. Certain water pumps and structures help maintain the pressure throughout and the plan is to sustain the demand even when everyone turns the tap on at 7am.

Optimal mainline pressure is always gonna be 200 psi, we love that number in distribution. Less or more happens all the time tho. But… it’s tough to get that, some people do, some people don’t. It all depends on how developed your district is. 
Now 200 psi is a lot, so your house line has a PRV (pressure releasing valve) down to 50-80 psi. Your garden hose at 200 psi will shoot about 40 feet, just to give you an idea. Used to be 100 psi was house standard, but that wastes a lot of water. 
Here’s the thing… your mainline is going to be effectively thousands of times larger than the flow through your house, and the pressure is way higher, so all the little differences are going to be minimal.
That being said, unless you have an automatically managed water tower, that pressure changes and moves around all the time… water pressure in a moving system with storage is a wildly complex thing, so a change of 10psi in a mainline throughout the day is totally normal, depending on levels and flow.

It's all about fluid dynamics.  If you have a container of water, or any other fluid, and you apply pressure to it - like a French press coffee maker or a piston -  the water exerts pressure in every direction equally.  For a clear example, if you have a balloon, and you push your finger into one side of it, the balloon expands in every other direction an equivalent amount. 
Imagine the water system like a very strangely shaped balloon made of copper pipes. You apply pressure at any point in the system, and every other point in the system experiences that pressure equally.  This balloon might have thousands of little points of escape - taps and fire hydrants - but if someone opens one of them, all you have to do is add more air to the balloon at any point to reset the system. 
A pumping station for a community introduces constant pressure to the water system at a single point, but that doesn't matter. Pressure anywhere = pressure everywhere.  Every single house experiences the change. When you turn on your tap, you're releasing a tiny bit of that pressure, and yes, every other house in your neighborhood experiences a slight fall in pressure when you do. However, given the strength of the pumps involved, that pressure is immediately replaced back to normal.  
Houses are like tiny holes in a leaky balloon. As long as someone keeps filling up the balloon, the tiny holes can be opened and closed.

Since water is an incompressible fluid, the only way that it can be pumped easily is with a centrifugal pump. At the well or tank, this is a big wheel spun by a great big electric motor and I needed spins the water around inside of a circular vessel with a pipe attached at one side. So in simple terms, the wheel throws the water against the opening of the pipe and the strength at which it does so creates the pressure in the system. When no water is flowing through the system, this force creates static pressure that presses on all parts of the system. When somebody opens a valve somewhere in the system that pressure forces the water through the system and into a sink or whatever. The flow of the water does slightly reduce the static pressure of the system, but as long as the total flow is lower than the rate at which the pump can throw water into the pipe then the pressure will remain fairly high. If the flow is high enough that either the pump is no longer able to throw enough water into the pipe or the friction of the water flowing through the pipe causes too great of a pressure loss than pressure will drop significantly and cause a lot of problems down the line. So back to your original question, each house that uses water along the pipe does reduce the pressure a little bit, but as long as you're within the acceptable operating range of the head pump, they houses downstream won't really notice the difference.
Some water systems have an intermediate pressure system that is then regulated down for neighborhoods to normal water pressure you see at your house and this helps equalize and balance out the system. While the large system can have significant pressure fluctuations. As long as its pressure is higher than what is needed, that's okay.

You don't generally see pH differences in the cerebral spinal fluid, our body does a pretty good job at regulating it. You DO see differences in pH in the cell, i.e. lysosome is about pH 4.6 and cytosol is about pH 7.2. Tau and beta amyloid protein do experience a range of pH environments. One of the hypothesis for the spread of tau is through the process of endocytosis, wherein a neuron that contains tau tangles may die and release the tau, then an adjacent neuron creates a pouch that internalizes outside contents (including tau proteins). This pouch becomes an endosome which becomes acidic in nature.
On the topic of the causation or symptom, it is unclear, but we do know there is a positive feedback loop. In clinic trials, we've gone after Abeta plaques, but these drugs show limited efficacy (Aducanumab is an FDA approved antibody that clears Abeta plaques, but again limited efficacy).

yfothk,https://www.reddit.com/user/Orange-Enough,3,"It looks like there's no definitive pathophysiology of sundowning, but several evidence-based hypotheses as to why it likely occurs.
TL;DR: parts of the brain effecting circadian rhythms, behavioral regulation, and stress response are changed/damaged. Environment and fatigue can also play a role.
According to Canevelli et al., 2016:
Sundowning could caused by a disruption in circadian rhythm due to alteration of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), basically the ""pacemaker"" of circadian rhythyms, located in the hypothalamus (forebrain). This naturally degenerates with age, but damage to this area is seen even more so in people with AD, as noted by neuronal loss and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. 
In severe AD, the SCN also shows reactive gliosis (the universal response to brain injury) in response to neuronal loss, with an increase in the astrocyte/neuron ratio. Essentially, a physiological response to brain injury in the hypothalamus interfering with regulation of sleep and emotional activity.
Additionally, circadian rhythms are regulated by melatonin, secreted by the pineal gland in response to darkness. The pineal gland's Melatonin functions are regulated by the SCN (which we know is damaged in AD). Melatonin is usually greatly reduced in people with AD, effecting circadian rhythms.
""Another possible cause is the degeneration of the cholinergic system. The SCN receive several cholinergic projections arising from the cholinergic forebrain and brain stem nuclei. Moreover, it is sensitive to cholinergic stimulation as demonstrated by the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors both in SCN neurons and astroglial cells. Thus, it may be hypothesized that the impaired cholinergic transmission may contribute to the disruption of circadian rhythms and the emergence of behavioral disturbances"" (Canevelli et al., 2016)
Another hypothesis is disruption/dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. In several studies, people with AD showing sundowning had significantly higher cortisol levels (stress response, regulated by HPA) than those without sundowning.
Lastly, environmental impacts such as decreased light exposure during the day (in a facility), fewer staff in late afternoon/evening, fatigue, and changes to or absence of daily routine have been associated with an overall worsening of NPS and the emergence of sundown syndrome

Exercise and diet in general helps with overall health, but if you're wondering how it helps with dementia, it improves vascular health. Your brain has a very complex network of tiny blood vessels, the more blocked up they get, the more neuronal death (neurodegeneration), which leads to increased risk of dementia. Exercise and diet helps keep those small capillaries healthy.
In terms of mental stimulation, there's a correlation between higher education and prolonging the effects of dementia (higher education less demented at the same age as those who didn't obtain higher education). The more you stimulate your brain, the more pathways it'll create for transmission of information. When one pathway gets destroyed, your brain will likely try to figure out another pathway, so having more pathways built leads to a better outcome for dementia.

It's entirely possible that pH is both ""stable"" (i.e. small standard deviation in normal people) AND significantly different in Alzheimer's. 
In fact, the more ""stable"" it is normal people (i.e. the smaller the standard deviation), the smaller a change needs to be in order to be significantly different in Alzheimer's. 
For example, if all healthy people have pH between 7.36 and 7.44, then pH of 7.3233 would be evidence of pathology.
That said, I don't believe there is any good evidence that the pH of CSF is significantly in Alzheimer's and controls.

Does the cerebral spinal fluid of people with Alzheimer's have a notably different pH from 'normal' people's?

Probably not, but not for the reasons others have stated (which are true).
Excess Tau Protein in the CSF is the only reliable assay test we have for Alzheimers, because the Tau protein escapes into the CSF, but Alzheimers isn't a disease of the CSF. Alzheimers is a disease of Neuron Cells in the Brain.
The better question might be - is the Neuronal pH of Alzheimers disease patients different from nominally health people?
I also don't know the answer to this question either, but you might be able to find out. I wouldn't expect there to be a global difference in pH - homeostatis is very effective and long term pH changes are make for very unhappy cells (i.e. necrosis and death), but whether the pH changes during acute stress events enough to make a difference is an interesting thought that someone may have pursued.

Other people have already mentioned that pH isn't that different, so I'd like to elaborate on the phase separation. It's unlikely that tau phase separates itself without other components (simple coacervation), but rather complexes with more molecules (complex coacervation). Because of this, LLPS can be triggered through concentration of either component or other solutes present in the cell, or perhaps even by the presence of sequence specific proteins/RNA. 
Furthermore, currently the oligomeric, soluble species are being pointed at as the main toxic species. This is not to say that the fibers don't have a role in disease progression (perhaps through spreading and fragmentation), just that they carry less toxic effects than the oligomers.
There's also the liquid-to-solid transition that's bejng discussed at the moment in literature, or my favourite, a pathway in which pre-existing LLPS compartments can influence and trigger protein aggregation.

CSF surrounds the brain and performs various functions. Within the mass of the organ the gaps between cells are filled with interstitial fluid. These are not the same.
Edit: there are protein aggregation diseases that are systemic and rather horrible. These are bundled together under the term amyloidosis. These do not involve the ""amyloid"" protein involved in alzheimers disease, rather a diverse range of proteins that aggregate for various reasons. The alzheimers amyloid protein was lumped into this historically. This was because it was recognised that protein clumping was a common feature as amyloid plaques were easily visible histologicaly because they show birefringence under Congo red staining.
These are different diseases from alzheimers but bear in mind that most neuro degenerative diseases involve some form of abnormal protein aggregation, from alpha synuclein in parkinsons to the poly-CAG-opathies such as Huntington disease.

Unless you are passing large, unbroken down food pieces, your body is absorbing part of what you are eating. 
And then you are hungry constantly, no necessarily due to caloric intake, but we need nutrients to trigger satiety (not mechanical fullness) as well.

Maybe that isn’t spoken about enough, but it doesn’t change the fact that you need to burn more calories than you take in to lose weight. 
If somebody finds that, using typical tracking tools, they don’t lose weight with a calorie deficit on paper, they need to take a deeper dive into that tracking. 
Instead of using my fitness pal or whatever app, they need to track their calorie intake and weight on a deeper level to determine their true TDEE (total daily energy expenditure). This works by tending calorie intake and weight gain/loss over several weeks/months, after which you can begin to scale the calorie intake up or down to begin meeting your goals. So long as the calorie unit they are inputting is relatively consistent across food types and their day to day metabolism, the actual calorie value is kind of arbitrary. It’s a way of finding consistency in your food intake and how your body responds to it. 
Obviously this method is more work than standard tracking, and take a lot of diligence, but it still relies on the same essential principles.

Most meds change appetite. So changes in them isn't a real issue in calibration.

Now if you are someone who isn't counting your calories, then changes in meds and whatever can have massive effects and it will be very frustrating.

There are also variations in individual microbiomes and physiology that influence how much energy is absorbed from food (an extreme example would be something like lactose intolerance, where someone cannot break down lactose and so doesn't receive much energy from it).
On the output side there are also factors that influence the amount of energy out. People with higher muscle mass have higher resting metabolism. While an individual can increase their muscle mass through exercise, genetic factors play a large role in how much that is possible. 
What that means is that two people eating exactly the same thing and engaging in the same amount of physical activity may not have the same rate of weight gain/loss.

So genes associated to obesity most strongly were ones related to academic achievement. So it really does come down to these mental genes around education and self control which are the major factors in obesity. 
So I think this means we need better education, people need to know they should have a better diet and exercise more.

ydyk2l,https://www.reddit.com/user/InTheEndEntropyWins,29,"The main reason people with thyroid issues gain weight is that their base metabolic rate is lower, so when they eat a normal amount they put on weight. 
So in your example, if you had a thyroid issue you might only burn 1,800 calories a day, so if you ate 1,900 calories you would put on weight. 
In that case if they wanted to lose weight, they would then need to eat less say 1,500 calories, or burn an additional 400300 calories through exercise. 
The amount of weight attributable to thyroids issues is usually only 5-10 lbs. So anyone obese is that way due to simply eating way too much rather than it being intrinsically linked to their thyroid. 
​

Since the BMR in a person with hypothyroidism is decreased, an underactive thyroid is generally associated with some weight gain.  
In general, 5-10 pounds of body weight may be attributable to the thyroid, depending on the severity of the hypothyroidism.

The most recent standards of care can be found here. The recomended standards of treatment are thus:     

6.1- We recommend health care professionals working with gender diverse adolescents:
6.1.a- are licensed by their statutory body and hold a postgraduate degree or its equivalent in a clinical field relevant to this
role granted by a nationally accredited statutory institution.
6.1.b- receive theoretical and evidenced-based training and develop expertise in general child, adolescent, and family mental
health across the developmental spectrum.
6.1.c- receive training and have expertise in gender identity development, gender diversity in children and adolescents, have
the ability to assess capacity to assent/consent, and possess general knowledge of gender diversity across the life span.
6.1.d- receive training and develop expertise in autism spectrum disorders and other neurodevelopmental presentations or
collaborate with a developmental disability expert when working with autistic/neurodivergent gender diverse adolescents.
6.1.e- Continue engaging in professional development in all areas relevant to gender diverse children, adolescents, and families.
6.2- We recommend health care professionals working with gender diverse adolescents facilitate the exploration and expression
of gender openly and respectfully so that no one particular identity is favored.
6.3- We recommend health care professionals working with gender diverse adolescents undertake a comprehensive biopsychosocial
assessment of adolescents who present with gender identity-related concerns and seek medical/surgical transition-related care,
and that this be accomplished in a collaborative and supportive manner.
6.4- We recommend health care professionals work with families, schools, and other relevant settings to promote acceptance of
gender diverse expressions of behavior and identities of the adolescent.
6.5- We recommend against offering reparative and conversion therapy aimed at trying to change a person’s gender and lived
gender expression to become more congruent with the sex assigned at birth.
6.6- We suggest health care professionals provide transgender and gender diverse adolescents with health education on chest
binding and genital tucking, including a review of the benefits and risks.
6.7- We recommend providers consider prescribing menstrual suppression agents for adolescents experiencing gender incongruence
who may not desire testosterone therapy, who desire but have not yet begun testosterone therapy, or in conjunction with
testosterone therapy for breakthrough bleeding.
6.8- We recommend health care professionals maintain an ongoing relationship with the gender diverse and transgender adolescent
and any relevant caregivers to support the adolescent in their decision-making throughout the duration of puberty suppression
treatment, hormonal treatment, and gender- related surgery until the transition is made to adult care.
6.9- We recommend health care professionals involve relevant disciplines, including mental health and medical professionals, to
reach a decision about whether puberty suppression, hormone initiation, or gender-related surgery for gender diverse and
transgender adolescents are appropriate and remain indicated throughout the course of treatment until the transition is made
to adult care.
6.10- We recommend health care professionals working with transgender and gender diverse adolescents requesting gender-affirming
medical or surgical treatments inform them, prior to initiating treatment, of the reproductive effects including the potential loss
of fertility and available options to preserve fertility within the context of the youth's stage of pubertal development.
6.11- We recommend when gender-affirming medical or surgical treatments are indicated for adolescents, health care professionals
working with transgender and gender diverse adolescents involve parent(s)/guardian(s) in the assessment and treatment process,
unless their involvement is determined to be harmful to the adolescent or not feasible.
The following recommendations are made regarding the requirements for gender-affirming medical and surgical treatment (All of them
must be met):
6.12- We recommend health care professionals assessing transgender and gender diverse adolescents only recommend
gender-affirming medical or surgical treatments requested by the patient when:
6.12.a- the adolescent meets the diagnostic criteria of gender incongruence as per the ICd-11 in situations where a diagnosis
is necessary to access health care. In countries that have not implemented the latest ICd, other taxonomies may be used although
efforts should be undertaken to utilize the latest ICd as soon as practicable.
6.12.b- the experience of gender diversity/incongruence is marked and sustained over time.
6.12.c- the adolescent demonstrates the emotional and cognitive maturity required to provide informed consent/assent for the treatment.
6.12.d- the adolescent’s mental health concerns (if any) that may interfere with diagnostic clarity, capacity to consent, and
gender-affirming medical treatments have been addressed.
6.12.e- the adolescent has been informed of the reproductive effects, including the potential loss of fertility and the available
options to preserve fertility, and these have been discussed in the context of the adolescent’s stage of pubertal development.
6.12.f- the adolescent has reached tanner stage 2 of puberty for pubertal suppression to be initiated.
6.12.g- the adolescent had at least 12 months of gender-affirming hormone therapy or longer, if required, to achieve the desired
surgical result for gender-affirming procedures, including breast augmentation, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, hysterectomy, phalloplasty,
metoidioplasty, and facial surgery as part of gender-affirming treatment unless hormone therapy is either not desired or is
medically contraindicated

Furthermore, doctors aren't hesitant to prescribe gender-affirming care because it's ""forefront"" or ""experimental"" and they don't want the risk.

In terms of consensus, this is p much it right here, there’s nothing binding a given physician to these particular standards, but I’d say a majority of the medical community (at least here in the US) largely agrees that these are the best guidelines for handling anyone of any age dealing with gender dysphoria (or who might be), although obviously with minors, especially pubescent minors, there are additional considerations, but the general consensus seems to be that with proper counseling and consideration, making sure that the patient understands the weight of making permanent decisions about their body, and of course parental consent, giving minors who’ve been determined to likely benefit from medical transition (or even just treatment with puberty blockers, if nothing else) should not be barred from access to it, that proper care for people suffering from gender dysphoria can be potentially life-saving, and that trans youth especially should not be denied the care they need due to the political machinations of people who aren’t even related to them (and likely don’t actually have their best interests in mind).
Anyway, trans people medically transitioning has been occurring for well over a century now, it is not a new phenomenon, just one that has recently been noticed by the mainstream a lot more, and the statistics over that long period of time generally suggest that it is very important for the well-being of a substantial minority of the population. 
The idea that is circulating in some circles currently that parents are somehow forcing their children to not conform to gender expectations based on their birth sex, or somehow inducing “gender confusion” in them, has no psychological or medical basis, and if it were to occur in some case, I’m sure the extensive counseling that youth undergo as per the standards of care would be able to find evidence of it (to my knowledge, I have never actually heard of a case like this, unless you count the tragic story of David Reimer being forcibly raised as a girl against his will after a botched circumcision, but that case was entirely one doctor’s unethical social experiment, and if anything actually demonstrates why gender dysphoria should be properly treated, as David always asserted he was a boy even against being told otherwise and forced to dress and behave as a girl, something that I’m sure many trans men can deeply relate to).
Doctors who oppose these standards of care (usually on almost solely political grounds) make up a minority of the medical community. It’s always important to remember that trans people people of all ages have existed for a long time without society falling apart at the seams, and will continue to do so.

The job of the therapist is to help the patient realize their best possible baseline, and if that involves lifelong issues, prepare them to meet their challenges effectively. It is always a dialogue and a moving target for the patient.

I am 70 so have been around a while, and am familiar both with THAT uncle, aunt or cousin who everyone knew was different but no one called them out on it as well as the neighborhood cross-dresser. From my viewpoint those were always around. This seems to be new.

Specifically on this topic, look at the Genspect open letter to the AAP accusing it of stifling debate on appropriate treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria.
Better even, look at the recent change in guidance by England’s National Health Services (their publicly-funded healthcare) regarding transgender minors- after a review of the available evidence they appear to be turning away from the (much cited in these responses) WPATH.  They suggest that it is much more likely for gender dysphoria in children to NOT persist through puberty and into adulthood - which would naturally suggest that transition, particularly more permanent transition via medication or surgery, isn’t appropriate.
Obviously there are physicians who believe that social/medical/surgical transition is appropriate for children, but there are also many physicians who think that that sort of treatment is inappropriate, or even unethical.

Forty percent of the global population lives within 100 km of the coast, and SWOT will provide better quality data closer to the coasts that can feed into models for improved forecasts of the state of the ocean and some extreme events that may impact people living at the coasts.

ysgpg0,https://www.reddit.com/user/Fleckeri,586,"To add ononto this, the more specific name for this sort of energy is surface energy , which is a really complicated (but interesting) subject that explains a lot ofabout why solid matter behaves as it does. 
In a nutshell, making more surfaces requires more surface energy to be invested into an object. This means that for most solid substances, new surfaces are not energetically favorable to make, which is why matter of the exact same type will generally stickfuse together ifinto a single object when they touch in thea right conditionsvacuum (see: cold welding). It’s also why energy normallytypically has to be added to things to make new surfaces from it — for example, slicing an apple with a knife, or shattering a rock with a hammer. 
Now this is generally a good thing because, if making surfaces were energetically favorable for most solids, then as many new surfaces as possibledivisions would suddenlyspontaneously be created betweenwherever everyphysically linkedpossible moleculeto maximize the total number of surfaces. This would then lead to a chain reaction of smaller and smaller surfaces being created that eventually causecauses the solid object to spontaneously flybreak apart into its individual molecules — a peculiar phenomenon known as sublimation#). After all, how could you make more surfaces in something than separating it into the smallest pieces possible?
This is actually what’s happenshappening when solid CO2 (“dry ice”) is “evaporating”goes straight intofrom solid to gas insteadwithout ofever melting into a liquid first:. allAll the little CO2 molecules that were happypreviously inNetflix-and-chilling (bonded) together on a very cold, low -pressure environmentcouch (freezer) abruptly hear the parents walking through the front door (are removed from freezer), which makes putting some distance (surfaces) between them suddenly experience a much hotter temperature that makes new surface formation looksound very appealing,. soSo all thethose little CO2s immediately start making everynew possiblesurfaces surfacebetween around themselvesthem so fast that they individually just individually fly off into the air.
Surface energy also applies to liquids, and differences between various materials’ surface energy is why some things get wet and some things don’t (e.g., why rain soaks right through a cotton shirt but rolls off a water-repellant jacket). But that’s a story for another day.

A lot of materials will oxidize in the atmosphere so the interface isn't just more of the same material which leads back to why cold welding tends to be a vacuum thing.
Even if you don't have an oxide layer you pretty commonly have adsorbed atoms from the atmosphere that are sticking to the surface because that's more energetically favorable than having your crystal lattice suddenly terminate with dangling bonds.  You can even get multiple layers of atoms all fairly randomly adsorbed onto the surface that on an atomic scale can add some surface roughness and prevent cold welding as well.  Water is a common example where you might just have a lot of hydroxyl groups on the surface but it can happen with stuff like nitrogen as well.

ysgpg0,https://www.reddit.com/user/Kraz_I,17,"Good question. You definitely took an intro to materials science class. The Miller Index is a dead giveaway. Basically, yes.  If you put those two pieces of salt directly together in a vacuum with nothing between, they would fuse. This is much easier to achieve with metals than ceramics, but it can be done with ceramics too. Metals undergo diffusion, and so do ceramics, but unbelievably slowly. 
Sintering is a common technique we use to make ceramics without melting or dissolving them in a liquid. In sintering, solid powders are squeezed together very tightly in a hydraulic press so that the grains all stick together loosely. Then they are baked in an oven. The hot temperatures allow diffusion to happen much faster, so the grains can create one solid mass. Sintered ceramics usually have some porosity as you might expect. 
I’ve seen some demonstrations of nano crystals fusing at the atomic level in an electron microscope. The smaller the surface relative to the area, the less surface area there is. At this scale, two crystal lattices that are lined up closely can indeed fuse to form a single lattice.

Broadly, atoms at corners and atop flat surfaces are very exposed; that is, they don't get a chance to bond as well as atoms within a surface. It's energetically preferable for atoms to join at ledges and steps, thus ultimately completing a flat surface. This is why we see faceting. The field is called growth kinetics.

For salt crystals, the flat faces of the cube is really really energetically favorable. You can cut it along a diagonal, but it's energetically favorable for the salt chunk to, instead of having a flat diagonal face, break up into little stairsteps made up of the flat faces. This is termed microfaceting, and is way more common among ionically bonded crystals than metals.
It's also used when growing thin films one atomic layer at a time. By intentionally having a slight mismatch between the film and the substrate, you can actually cause certain stairstepping at desired intervals. This is useful for some applications.

As others have pointed out, if there is a lot of moisture around, grains of NaCl can clump up into larger solids.  These are NOT single crystals, but instead are composed of many individual crystals that are fused together by tiny amounts of NaCl that have dissolved and re-crystallized in between them.

It's a property called cleavage. Salts with impurities (think iron, magnesium, etc) can alter the structure slightly, but generally salt breaks the same always. 
So essentially, your table salt will start out as a big crystal, then is broken down into fine particles, and anti-caking products will sometimes be added.
Crystal formation is a process that is determined by the balance between three factors: saturation, nucleation rates, and the rate of diffusion in a solution. Basically, if you don't have adequate saturation, crystallization won't happen. If your nucleation rate is high, you will have fast crystal growth. This could mean lots of tiny crystals (think drusy quartz) if diffusion rates are low, or smaller numbers of medium crystals with higher diffusion rates. With slower nucleation rates and higher diffusion rates, you'll end up with few very large, pure crystals (think large clear quartz points)
In the table salt example, if the salt gets wet (even from humidity), partial dissolution and recrystallization will form smaller aggregate crystals willthat fuse the particles together,. butBut it won't appear to look like a crystal... Justjust annoyingly caked salt. In order to form a single larger crystal again though, the salt must be fully dissolved, be oversaturated in water, and have adequate time and diffusion rates to nucleate onto larger crystals.

ysgpg0,https://www.reddit.com/user/Busterwasmycat,1,"time is a big factor.  How much time you need depends a lot on system energy.  Hot systems will see recrystallization and gap infilling way faster than cold systems.  The basic issue is that some atoms must move in order to re-make the structure and join two distinct crystals into one, and the chances of that happening is low.  The energy barrier is too high. Few atoms achieve the amount of energy required to leave a comfortable chair and move into a slightly more comfortable chair that is over there, joining the two different confortable groups into one bigger group.  If you wait long enough, it will happen.

yc1anh,https://www.reddit.com/user/OnceIsForever,1713,"There were a few competing ideas but here is a summary of the ones I know of:
- The sun was very hot due to some past event and was gradually cooling down i.e. it didn't have an internal energy source.
- It was a material gradually collapsing under its own gravity. This gradual crushing was leading to heating of the inner material and this thermal energy was conducted away to the surface.
- The sun's heat was a result of chemical reactions i.e. it's genuinely a ball of 'fire' .
[EDIT - forgot this one]  - Even before nuclear fusion was discovered there were other processes like atomic decay which were posited. Some nuclear isotopes are naturally warm to the touch because of the amount of heat they release.
- Some combination of the above.
When you do the calculations for each of these, the problem you quickly come to is that the sun would run out energy relatively quickly i.e. hundreds of thousands, or millions of years versus billions. One must remember though that in Victorian era where people began to work out these above cases, nobody knew the age of the universe, solar system or even earth to any degree of precision. 
[Edit] I'd also like to add that the exact form that fusion takes (proton-proton chain vs CNO cycle) is still an area of research and depends on exactly which star and in what stage of its life it happens to be.

One of the ideas explored, which you haven't mentioned but is interesting, is the possibility of meteorites falling into the sun, adding to the internal energy.
When radioactivity was discovered, it was relatively soon (rather correctly) discarded as a plausible resolution to the sun part of the paradox, since the added energy from radioactive decay was completely insufficient to explain the disparity.

Oh, we would. It would probably kill off most of the life on Earth. And probably ALL of the surface life. Why? Thermodynamic equilibrium. 
The total estimated energy output of the sun is 1.23 x 10 ^ 35 joules per year. The total amount of heat needed to warm the 1.898 × 1027 kg mass of Jupiter to 5778K, the temperature of the sun's surface, is around 1.91E35 joules. Therefore, math tells us that it would take more than 15 years for the sun to heat the gasses of Jupiter sufficiently to reach equilibrium. That would cause a massive reduction in solar output as that thermal energy is absorbed by Jupiters relatively cool gasses mixing into the outer layers of the sun. The Earth would become an orbiting icecube for decades. We're not just talking about cold winters or even an ice age. We're talking about ""You can drive from Los Angeles to Hawaii because the ocean is frozen over"" cold. 
Ultimately, the collision would have no long-term impact on the sun. Once equilibrium was reached, the sun would once again be its normal self, with its typical output, and there would be no measurable changes to indicate what had occurred. In the short term, a collision like that would be very, very, very bad for those of us who rely on the sun for our existence.

In reality, I think this would depend a bit on the initial conditions, like do we just park Jupiter in an orbit so it gets slowly siphoned away, or does it smash into the sun. Convection would do most of the work here if the masses can get sufficiently mixed. 
Assuming that sun is homogenous and at 5500K (yeah, yeah) and that Jupiter is at 4K gives us a mixed temperature of 5490K, which will lower the solar output, but only by around 0.7% assuming Stefan-Boltzmann.

A. About ninety-five millions of miles.
Light, which moves at the rate of about 200,000 miles in a second, requires nearly eight minutes and a quarter to travel from the Sun to the Earth; and a railroad car, moving at the rate of thirty miles an hour, would require three hundred and sixty years to travel from the Earth to the Sun.

yc1anh,https://www.reddit.com/user/AlekBalderdash,1,"Basically no, but it depends what you mean by ""moon"" which gets a little fuzzy.
Mars has Phobos and Demos, but they seem similar to largish asteroids.  Saturn and Jupiter have dozens of moons, but lots of them are little and I don't think the average person really ""counts"" them as a ""moon"".  They're a natural satellite, but I think people generally assume a minimum size and a vaguely round shape, ideally by mass/gravity and not by chance.  AKA, a golfball sized rock isn't a moon even if it's round.
So basically I think Phobos and Demos are approaching the ""not a moon"" threshold but people seem fine with calling them moons.
Now, Pluto and Charon are weirder.  Charon isn't a satellite of Pluto, they're actually satellites of each other, circling a point in space between them.  Moons and planets always circle a mutual point in space, but usually the point is inside the planet and is fairly close to the center, because the planet is so much bigger.
So if two basically-the-same-size objects are in orbit, they spin around the point between them.  You don't really have a ""primary"" and a ""moon"" you have a Binary system.  People seem OK with calling Pluto and Charon a Planet/Moon, but this is probably more traditional/emotional than a rational or consistent classification.  #TeamPluto
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto

Pluto has five known moons: Charon, the largest, whose diameter is just over half that of Pluto; Styx; Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body, and they are tidally locked.

 
Think of it like this:  If you pick up a child or small pet, you can spin them around.  You are holding them and spinning them.  You are the primary, they are the moon.
You can't pick up a person the same size as yourself and spin them around.  Even if you had the muscles to do so, you'd be thrown off balance.  You have to hold heavy things close to your body or you fall over.
 
So that's, basically, a moon:  Something you have to hold with TWO hands, but can still spin without falling.  
If you can hold it with one hand while spinning it's probably too small to call a moon.  
If it's so big you can't hold it and spin you no longer have a Primary/Moon.  Now you have a dance partner, and we call that a Binary System.

OfThat course, thatcalculation requires knowledge of the size of the Earth's orbit, but that was available from Cassini in 1672.  Cassini and Richer made simultaneous observations from Paris and French Guiana of the position of Mars relative to the distant stars.  They did this at opposition, which approximates Mars perigee.  From that, they triangulated to get the Earth-Mars distance. 
I can't seem to find a source on how they did convert Earth-Mars distance to Earth-Sun, but it sounds like that's using Kepler's 3rd law, giving you relationships between their orbital periods (which can be observed) and their relative distances.  If eccentricity is assumed to be zero (circular orbits), this lets you compute Sun-Earth and Sun-Mars distances from the orbital periods and the closest Earth-Mars distance.
I find these questions — of what could be known given a subset of current knowledge — to be interesting.  They might also suggest ways of thinking beyond current knowledge: if we were to add knowledge of X, what Y could we determine?  If that could be interesting, maybe we should try to determine X.
The teaching of history tied to particular years often seems dreary and pointless, but the connections in history between one thing and its prerequisite (like the speed of light requiring the size of the Earth's orbit, determined only four years prior) can be much more interesting.

It’s still quite impressive, make no mistake, but it’s not the “craziest” thing humanity has figured out very early. I stopped underestimating older civilizations when I read Meditations (Marcus Aurelius). His understanding of the world around him surprised me, especially given that he wasn’t really a scientist. The book is mostly motivational/philosophical but there are a couple of things that stood out to me. 
Here’s an example: 
“The sun is seen to pour itself down and expend itself in all directions, yet it is never exhausted … [watch a sunbeam] as it streams into a darkened room through a narrow chink. It prolongs itself forward in a straight line, until it is held up by encountering one solid body which blocks the passage to the air beyond and then it remains at rest there, without slipping off or falling away. The emission and diffusion of thought should be the counterpart of this: not exhausting, but simply extending itself; not dashing violently or furiously against the obstacles it encounters, not yet falling away in despair; but holding its ground and lighting up that upon which it rests”. 
Alternatively there’s stuff like “observe always that everything is the result of change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing Nature/the Universe loves so much as to change existing forms and to make new ones like them” or “Consider that before long you will be nobody and nowhere, nor will any of the things exist that you now see, nor any or those who are now living. For all things are formed in nature to change and be turned and to perish in order that other things in continuous succession may exist”. 
His understanding is a bit limited by his time and lack of tools that accurately measure our surroundings but there are many wise conclusions that can be drawn if you go down this philosophical rabbit hole. And that’s merely one example of an educated politician. There have been people smarter than him that were born earlier, too.

The distance to and thus the size of the sun was measured fairly early by Cassini in the late 1600s, so after Lavoisier figured out how combustion actually works about a century later, the calculated best-case scenarios for how long it would take to burn to ash was considerably shorter than the estimated geologic age of the Earth. So scientists knew there was something else at work, but couldn’t think of anything that would be energetic and long-lasting enough.
Helmholtz and others proposed heating through gravitational attraction, but the math for that didn’t work out either.

yc1anh,https://www.reddit.com/user/reidacdc,2,"I don't recall where I read this, but I've seen an early-20th-century book that has an interesting exploration of the idea, though not a solution.
If you suppose that the sun's energy source is gravitational, and that there's some unknown mechanism internal to the sun that converts gravitational self-energy into heat and radiates it away, you can compute the rate at which the sun should be shrinking as this process takes place, based on its mass and how much energy it's emitting. This model has a problem -- the calculated rate of shrinkage should be observable as a change in the diameter of the sun's disk over the course of a few years, but it is not observed, the size of the sun is in fact relatively stable.
The book proposes that perhaps the sun's mass is replenished by in-falling dust and rocks, and estimates that an amount of mass sufficient to replenish the sun in this model could be falling on it without it being readily observed. As I recall, the book finds this answer to be very unsatisfactory, but can't do any better.

Kind of like a dog can sniff and follow a scent trail from a very faint signature, following the trail until it is eventually on top of the target. Immune cells like the one in the video (presumably a monocyte or macrophage) have receptors specifically designed for Pathogen-Associated-Molecular-Patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are molecules that are found on bacteria, fungi, viruses etc that our immune cells have evolved to recognize with receptors specific to them (antibodies not needed). An example of a PAMP is endotoxin/LPS that is a part of the bacterial cell wall. So for example, the bacteria sheds LPS or other pieces of its cell wall as it floats around, and the immune cell ""sniffs"" it out with its receptor and starts following the trail. 
It gets more complex. There are hierarchical signals for what determines which direction an immune cell will migrate. For example, if local tissue cells realize there is an active ongoing infection, they will secrete ""red flag"" signals to recruit nearby immune cells to the area. These signals are called chemokines. So the immune cell floating around your blood will first detect the chemokines and realize something is wrong, and will enter the area where they are coming from. From that point on, if it senses PAMPs (the bacterial molecules), it'll switch and start moving toward the bacteria.

Some bacteria create decoy molecules that the plant senses and attempts to protect itself from while the bacteria invade essentially from a different direction, chemically speaking. There are all kinds of masking abilities that bacteria have developed, and plants are constantly developing their own ways of figuring out the mask. Keep in mind, this is over many, many generations. plants that have “learned“ to detect these new bacterial invasions are the ones that continue to survive, and the bacteria that have changed their chemistry or invasion styles are likewise the ones that have survived.

yia9a5,https://www.reddit.com/user/sharplydressedman,25,"Well, yes and no - this will require a bit of a deeper dive into immunology. Our immune system has two general branches, the adaptive (slower but can ""learn"") and innate (quick but limited to pre-determined common patterns). There isn't a ""red list"" per se for the innate immune system since it is evolutionarily more efficient for our innate immune cells to have the receptors for the definitely dangerous patterns, and let the adaptive immune system ""learn"" which patterns are safe. 
As a metaphor for the innate immune system, the TSA displays a list of things that are definitely banned on planes. They may not need to have a list of things  that are ""definitely safe"", they can figure that out along the way. 
Anyway to return to your question, the adaptive immune system DOES have the ability to identify molecules that are safe. ""Mucosal tolerance"" refers to the ability of the body to suppress immune responses against antigens that are encountered in the gastrointestinal tract. This is not only to protect the commensal bacteria that live in our intestines, but also prevents our immune system from flaring up against the molecules in our food.

yeah, they aren't identical. But, if you think about it, scale the brain down to a single cell? Now protiens and enzymes are the neurotransmiters, orgenels and some protiens are the ""brain cells"".

your right. Smell is quite complex. I mean, most of ""taste"" is smell. We can only truly ""taste"" 5 things. Sweet (To locate sugars and starches, for metabalisim), Salt, ""Unami"" (To locate necesary protiens), Bitter (To locate toxins. That's why pills are bitter. Your body sees it as something extremly foreing, so it's ""bitter""), and Sour (to detect unripe/ overripe fruits, and prevent over-consumption of acids). We can ""Taste"" spice, as it fires all five. If you stimulate all of them just right, you can make something that tastes simalar to food. But, with normal food, most of the taste is a combination of taste buds, and the smell going in your nose!
But, the mechanisims are similar. This ""particulate to action"" would, eventually, be modified into taste!

The specific important part is the N-Formylmethionine, which is used for initiation of protein synthesis in bacteria and mitochondria (and chloroplasts, but we don't need to talk about those here). It is not used for protein synthesis for eukaryotic cells (except in the aforementioned mitochondria). The terminal fMet gets chopped off by Methionyl aminopeptidase on many proteins, but not on all of them.
So, if your immune system is ""seeing"" N-Formylmethionine on oligopeptides, it either means that bacteria are around, or that cells are exploding and the mitochondria are popping with them, which itself is something the immune system should check out.

yia9a5,https://www.reddit.com/user/BeardsandBio,94,"In the simplest terms, when good cells die they breakdown and leave a flare behind. The scout white blood cells immediately go there to investigate and try and quarantine off the area and once they're there they also release a big smoke signal which attracts the calvary. The scout cells CAN fight but they're undertrained and poorly equipped.
Once the calvary and scouts are fighting, they'll often send a messenger back home who contacts the specialist to come join the rightfight... the specialist are veteran cells who trained to fight in specific conditions and better equipped.

It's to disadvantage the invader and provides an advantage to the defense.

yia9a5,https://www.reddit.com/user/goldblumspowerbook,35,"I refer you to the lyrics of the great scientific work/rap song “Ridin’ Dirty” by UGKChamillionaire*. 
“They see me rollin’”—selectins are weaker adhesion molecules that are expressed on blood vessel walls due to local inflammation caused by bacteria. These cause white blood cells to roll along the walls of the blood vessels (rather than floating) in the area of an infection. 
“They hatin’”—cytokines and chemokines, floating protein mediators of inflammation, cause white blood cells to be activated and get primed to eat and destroy bacteria 
“Patrollin’”—when they reach the area of the injury, where the maximum amount of chemokines are, the white cells use integrins, deep proteins under the endothelial cells, to pull their way out of the blood vessels. In the tissues they eat foreign material, continue to express inflammatory mediators, and many of them die, forming the gross white substance of puss. 
“Tryin’a catch me ridin’ dirty”—bacteria express foreign molecules on their cell surfaces such as lipopolysaccharide. These pathogen-associated molecular patterns identify them as foreign or dirty and tag them for endocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. 
“Tryin’a catch me ridin’ dirty”—complement is a protein in the blood which can be activated through multiple inflammatory means and tags infectious organisms for destruction as well as kills infected cells. This is a second way for foreign material to be recognized.

To quote part of the description on the book's webpage:

In 2005, Steven Rinella won a lottery permit to hunt for a wild buffalo, or American bison, in the Alaskan wilderness. Despite the odds—there’s only a 2 percent chance of drawing the permit, and fewer than 20 percent of those hunters are successful—Rinella managed to kill a buffalo on a snow-covered mountainside and then raft the meat back to civilization while being trailed by grizzly bears and suffering from hypothermia.

Short answer, nothing special. There’s not a lot of acid in the stomach by volume and our instruments are more than capable of handling it.
Longer answer. Stomach acid and bile is really caustic if released into the abdomen and can cause you to be very sick (perforated ulcers, for instance)
A tube put into the stomach through the nose (NG tube) can decompress the stomach and make it not leak as much if there is a hole prior to going to surgery. We can then irrigate and neutralize any spilled acid during the surgery, this is very routine for any abdominal operation.

So, overall dose-wise, a lot of these rats would have been low-level users based on historical aggregate data. 
I wouldn’t say it makes a huge difference, but it’s hard to interpret here whether the high-level users are even getting a dose that would be considered as having validity for addiction. There isn’t even an extinction phase reported (Admittedly I could have missed it, I skimmed). Is there withdrawal or physical changes? It’s unfortunate that they used a dose that makes it hard to interpret in the context of their other work. 
The long and the short of it, though, is that rats (most rodents) are highly social creatures. The standard paradigm of single-housing animals in any study does confound behavior, brain chemistry, etc, which can affect the data researches are trying to extrapolate to human conditions.

Should they use the single-housed model, or should they used the enrich model? It seems obvious that they should use the enriched model because it more closely models human’s social interactions.

My understanding isn’t well enough either to give you a short but concise summary, I’ll try anyway…
Afaik it goes like this: Let’s say you suspect a whole bunch of factors A, B, C, … J having an influence on X but you don’t really know which and how much. the traditional way of determining their influence is keeping all but one, say B, constant and then varying B while measuring X. But if the individual effect of B on X is small you’d need a lot of measurements, let’s say 10, in order to get statistical significant results. But now you’ve found only the influence of one factor. To find  out about all other factors can be prohibitively time and or resources consuming. 
So what you do is varying all or subsets of your factors at once while measuring the effect on X. But how can anyone make sense of the data then? How can you tell which factor was responsible for any measured effect of X? 
Here comes PCA. The dataset is then fitted into a multidimensional space with each influencing factor representing an orthogonal axis. The cloud of datapoints is then modeled by a multidimensional but linear function. The you look at how this line lies in that space in regard to the individual axises. Axis ie factors that run parallel or close to parallel don’t have a lot of influence, while axis that are orthogonal or close to it have a very high influence. The user then sets a cut off point and then creates a model with all factors that contribute more than the cut off point.

y56jte,https://www.reddit.com/user/Atiggerx33,2,"If you're studying the effects of isolation on addiction (or w.e. else) than yes obviously keeping rats isolated is the perfect study (at least using rats).
The 'principle component' would generally be the ""primary cause(s)"" of addiction. The issue is the original study labeled ""easy access to drugs"" a primary cause based on the research; which I'd argue the primary cause was rather the extreme loneliness and abject misery the rats lived in. If you're completely alone and miserable, being kept in solitary confinement your whole life... well why not use drugs heavily at that point? Your life can't possibly suck worse, and it offers a brief respite, and (hypothetically if rats were actually capable of comprehending the risks) even if it kills you at least the hell is over. 
The main issue is that we continue to do studies today on isolated rats when not specifically studying ""the effects of isolation on X"". Who knows to what extent abject misery effects the results of those experiments. Prolonged high levels of cortisol (stress hormone) which are generally present in isolated rats effects brain development, physical, and mental health. So all studies we do on isolated rats (like cancer treatments and the like) are being done on miserable animals who have negative health effects from high levels of prolonged stress. That has to have some impact, and not a positive one.
Again, if you're studying the effects of isolation on whatever than yeah, isolation is an important factor (but ideally there should also be a control group of happy, well-socialized rats to compare the isolated group to at the end). But when you're studying literally anything else than isolation it is going to likely affect your results. If you're doing something like maze experiments for example the fact that prolonged high levels of cortisol result in decreased brain development is absolutely having an impact on your results.

y56jte,https://www.reddit.com/user/Guggoo,410,"This is based on the rat park experiments. Basically the original experiments for determining if drugs were addictive and dangerous were performed on rats in cages, who kept taking drugs even excluding food and water, so it was thought that drugs are super dangerous and addictive.
Rat park basically repeated the experiment but instead of the rats being in little isolated cages, they had a rat sanctuary where they could interact with other rats and run around and stuff. And they found the rats did not take the drugs to the detriment to their health anymore, rarely engaging with them. Moreover, they switched the rats from the isolated rat trial (the druggie rats) and they were able to recover in rat park, willingly suffering the withdrawl symptoms to hang out with the other rats.
This was essentially to shine a light on tge fact that chemical dependance is not the only reason people use drugs. The war on drugs made Drugs(tm) the ultimate bad guy that will destroy you. But this experiment puts forward that if you see you life as a park or a cage has a factor (but those are social factors and require systemic changes).
Now this experiment has been criticized over the years as it has been used rhetorically to argue that drugs are basically harmless, mostly from those ""weed/LSD is good for you man"" guys. It was a limited study. Whatmore we aren't rats, it's actually pretty hard to make assertions about how humans would fair from animal trials. Humans have way more going on than rats do. You would need to scale the experiment up and probably do some monkey trials, and then humans but obviously you are gonna run into ethical issues there.
It is still a really cool experiment though. It reminds us that we are complicated and that the factors in our lives push and pull us in different directions, both within and without you.

I don't know how much medical morphine was diverted for recreational use in Vietnam; my guess is that given the morale/discipline in Vietnam, some was, but it probably wasn't that easy and everyone was vested in the medic being able to deliver morphine doses to the injured which served to make diversion problematic.
I've heard the rest of that story before -- GIs used black market heroin, often so pure it could be smoked in a cigarette without losing so much potency it didn't work, and that when the GIs returned home their dependency evaporated because they were out of the stress/trauma of combat.
It aligns with the rat park experiments, but I have questions.  I'd guess a fair amount of recreational heroin use was not very heavy or almost medicinal in nature (infrequent, perhaps taken as an actual ad-hoc pain relief after long patrols, etc).  Staying in supply with black market heroin probably wasn't easy if your unit is in an active combat zone away from civilian population centers.
I'd guess that part of what made the ""Vietnam addictions"" supposedly go away was that most users weren't seriously dependent on it, and in reality were infrequent users due to conditions, limited access, or even limited interest.  That means going home and not using heroin is pretty easy.  But if you were a serious addict, I don't think change of address is quite enough to make an actual addiction go away.

He has a background in family practice and a special interest in childhood development, trauma and potential lifelong impacts on physical and mental health including autoimmune disease, cancer, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) addictions and a wide range of other conditions.
Maté's approach to addiction focuses on the trauma his patients have suffered and looks to address this in their recovery. In his book In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction, Maté discusses the types of trauma suffered by persons with substance use disorders and how this affects their decision making in later life.*”

Firstly, studies in non-humans are, by definition, pre-clinical studies. Clinical trials only occur in humans, and not every study in humans is a ""clinical trial.
Secondly, I believe you are referring to alcohol-preferring (P) rats. P rats were selectively bred for their alcohol consumption. They were not forced to drink alcohol - high-drinking rats from an outbred population (I believe Wistars) were bred with other high-drinkings rats for many generations, resulting in a strain of rats that overall consumes more than other outbred populations. This hits on ""natural occurring rats"" - there are most certainly outbred rats that consume high levels of alcohol. That's how these types of specialized strains are generated. If you're interested in the P rats, I suggest reading Bell et al. 2006 Addict Biol (REVIEW: The alcohol-preferring P rat and animal models of excessive alcohol drinking), if you can access it.
Third, people aren't ""bred"" to do anything. Yes, almost everything has a genetic component, from alcohol use to schizophrenia and cancer. Generally, though, genes drive 20% of less of the variance in the likelihood that you'll develop whatever you're genetically pre-disposed towards. So yes, someone with two parents with an alcohol use disorder is more likely to also develop an alcohol use disorder. But that doesn't mean that they find alcohol to be ""more addicting."" It also doesn't mean that the only people with familial history of alcohol use disorders will develop an alcohol use disorder.
Fourth, non-peer reviewed books by singular ""experts"" are their personal interpretation and beliefs of the state of the field. They can be great starting places to introduce yourself to something. If you find yourself super interested, though, I always suggest to navigate directly to the source material and read it yourself, then make your own informed position.

Mainly because the reward mechanism hardwired to mammalian brains, such as the increased concentrations of dopamine and other monoamines (the basic effect of cocaine), can alleviate isolation and depression momentarily. So the study you're referring to, although a little limited, demonstrated that isolated and depressed animals tended to be more addicted than those in the Rat Park. Obviously, this is not the entire truth. Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines can and will destroy normal functioning of the brain due to their agressive mechanisms. These two factors, psychological and biological, must be worked in tandem to effectively treat addictons and that's why today the ideal treatment includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures.

yheipf,https://www.reddit.com/user/Busterwasmycat,905,"The general idea of wave behavior is that waves reflect when obstructions are repeated and have a gap range smaller than the wavelength (so the wave ""sees"" the series of objects as if they are a solid wall). When wavelengths get down into the range of the gap size, diffraction occurs.  When gap sizes are way bigger than wavelength, nothing really happens to the waves. it is as though no such objects were even present.
So, for your question, you have to consider what the wavelength of the energy is, and for gamma rays it is on the order of picometers (the range is actually several orders of magnitude, but for discussion, 1011 m is the big end and picometers is 10-12 m).
The spacing between atoms in a typical crystal structure is longer than about 100 picometers, so gamma rays, except perhaps the very long end of the range, basically do not see crystalline solids as ""solid"" structures (the gaps are big enough that the waves pass through mostly unaffected, as if nothing were there at all). So, there are no crystalline solids which can reflect gamma rays.  You would have to get into subatomic matter and such materials do not cluster in large enough masses to create an important obstruction.
Sort of like an island a few km offshore from land.  The small waves do ""see"" the island and get blocked and reflected by it, but the overall pattern of waves is unaffected (only a small proportion of the waves are obstructed by the lone object and the rest move on unchanged).  There are no substances we possess or can create which can produce the regular obstructions at the necessary tiny gap size needed to force gamma rays to reflect instead of basically ignore them.
There are things that can be done using energy fields though, but I don't know much about that at all.  Not basic knowledge for a geologist (basic optics is, because of optical mineralogy and coloration of minerals-we geologists are jacks of all trades in science terms - we know something about a bit of everything).

Having done some optical mineralogy in Uni, I have nothing but respect for those who are actually comfortable with the study of crystalline structures and how we could guess them out using various frequencies of electromagnetic radiations.

yheipf,https://www.reddit.com/user/HerraTohtori,18,"Yes, but neutrons are not elemental particles. They consist of quarks which each have a partial electric charge. In case of protons, the sum of quark charges comes up to one positive elementary charge; in case of a neutron, the charges of individual quarks neutralize each other.
But the quarks are bound together via gluons, the transmitter bosons of strong nuclear force, and that binding is extremely strong indeed. So while one quark in a neutron might experience the gamma photon's electric field pushing it in some direction, the other quarks with different charges would end up experiencing opposite forces.
Which means that the strong nuclear force holding the quarks together would be stressed, but the neutron overall would experience no net force in any direction.
So I guess the question is - would the quarks in neutron-generate matter be packed close enough together to form a surface that appears ""solid"" in the scale of gamma photons, and would the individual quarks be allowed to ""wiggle"" enough to produce a reflection.´
If not, then the gamma photons would just be absorbed or scattered much like when they hit regular matter - but in case of hitting a neutron star, I think the density is so high that practically all of it would end up being absorbed.
Beyond neutron-degenerate matter, there is the potential of quark-gluon plasma producing some different results. But with these exotic forms of matter, the energy density is so high that everything with a charge is probably emitting some gamma photons just by virtue of existing in that state, so it's kind of similar to asking if the surface of a star can reflect light (the answer is yes, by the way, stars do reflect light but not much - high temperature stars reflect a few percent of light hitting them, lower temperature stars like the Sun reflect less than 0.1% of the light hitting them).

I don't know what the record is for photon energy reflected.
Edit: By contrast, the higher energy instrument on the Fermi gamma ray space telescope observes gamma rays from 20 MeV to 300 GeV, so at the high end that's over 3 million times as energetic as what NuSTAR observes.

TL;DR: microwaves are low enough energy that they're non ionizing. The food isn't getting contaminated either, just irradiated. Also check out this website- https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/around-us/doses-daily-lives.html
You're right that wifi is similar to microwaves (idk the specifics). What they should be more worried about than microwaves though is the sun, because UV is higher energy than microwaves (that's how you get sunburned).
What I deal with, among other things, are X-rays and Gamma rays, which are even more high energy than UV. From day 1 in training, we're taught ""ALARA principles"" (As Low As Reasonably Achievable); the big three are Time (minimize how long you're around the source), Distance (use long handled tools & observe from farther away/use sensors or cameras etc), and Shielding (x-ray & gamma can't really go around corners well; also you could use lead blocks (this is why why you wear a lead apron when you get dental x-rays) etc).
Another thing people get mixed up is ""contamination"" vs ""irradiation."" Irradiation is what happens if you stand near a source too long; you get irradiated. Contamination is the source spilling and physically getting on your clothes (or hopefully just your PPE). An analogy I heard that's gross but accurate; contamination is like stepping in dog poop, but irradiation is just the smell of the dog poop.
Low levels of irradiation is okay; I mean, we're told that going out and getting sunlight is good for us. It's like it helps the cells in our bodies ""stay in shape"" as they repair the occasional mishap. But remember, UV is high enough energy to be ionizing; visible light, microwaves, etc aren't. That's why you can listen to the radio in your car with no adverse affects too. You can irradiate food from leaving it out in the sun too long, but we eat apples that have been out on their trees for months.
Tangent: you wear a lead apron for X-rays to protect your other body parts from the X-rays. Now think about how often the doctor/nurse/operator person administers these X-rays. It's easier for them to just run around the corner, since X-rays don't really travel around corners. It's not dangerous once or twice a year, but they're probably around it multiple times a day every day, which over time is more dangerous.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a whole website for more cool info. I've pulled the ""every-day doses."" Keep in mind that, even before technology, we were still getting low doses from just being alive (things like the sun, cosmic radiation, natural uranium/etc in the ground). https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/around-us/doses-daily-lives.html

This is why gamma ray space observatories use grazing incidence mirrors to focus the incoming gamma rays. Similar designs are used at particle accelerators to harvest radiation for other use.
Now if you want something close to normal incidence, things become much more difficult and you need to use Bragg reflectors (i.e., multilayers of materials with alternating index of refraction that is tuned to the wavelength you want to reflect). These work as well (e.g., in semiconductor production machines), but you will be restricted to a narrow band of wavelengths and incidence angles, and you may be restricted by the available materials.

An electron beam is  accelerated to high speeds towards the anode where photoelectric and bremmstrahlung interactions take place, resulting in energy released as an extreme amount of heat and some X-rays which are emitted isotropically. The X-rays that leave the tube do so through a radiolucent “window” forming the useful xray beam. The rest of the X-rays produced are absorbed by the tube housing. 
The rotation of the anode is for heat dissipation. The electron beam can literally melt a hole through the tungsten target. Even with the high rotations, a lot of X-ray tubes tend to be replaced because of vaporization of the tungsten and it’s deposition on the tube walls creating an electrical short from the cathode to anode.

Shouldn't the equivalent terms for radioactivity be something like radio-opaque, transradiant and... Urm... transparent?
Radiolucent means radio-light, which sort of sounds like nonsense. Translucent means light gets through. Shouldn't it be transradiant?

I went to school for and worked as a radiologic technologist for years. Radiolucent and radiopaque were the standard terms used in radiology by both technologists and radiologists (ie: “the X-ray shows multiple radiolucent lesions”)
There may be more technically correct terms from a physician standpoint, but at this point it’s an established set of terms use in medicine. I’d be interested to see if it was terms used initially because of its time period and the definition of -lucent adapted to reflect that over time, or if it’s just terms used by tradition, which does happen.

ydc8h6,https://www.reddit.com/user/regular_modern_girl,19,"I’m guessing blindness and other neurological symptoms during the era of prohibition were probably the result of both methanol and adulterants to some degree. 
But this is definitely correct, methanol for sure causes severe nerve damage up to and including blindness and death if consumed in any significant concentration (even inhaling it is apparently a really bad idea), and blindness as a result of home-distilled spirits is still a problem which pops up now and then from my understanding. There are trace amounts of (very dilute) methanol in some naturally -fermented alcohols like fruit wines iirc, but in a non-distilled drink the ratio of ethanol-methanol is so in favor of ethanol that any toxic effects of the methanol are negated, but if you distill that same alcohol and don’t do it right (not taking care to boil off any possible methanol content), then serious health risks definitely arise (also, this is also part of why freeze distillation isn’t more common even though it on the surface appears easier and safer than heat distillation; doing it with a lot of types of alcohol carries a real risk of concentrating methanol without any heat to evaporate it away).
I’ve also seen a theory blaming methanol for absinthe’s (fictitious) historical reputation as a hallucinogen, but personally I find that really unlikely just because enough methanol to cause that severe of symptoms would likely just be outright deadly, and there are much better explanations for the mythology around absinthe (myths propagated by a moral panic and perpetuated by artists and counterculturalists, alcoholics mistaking delirium tremens or possibly severe drunkenness for something more exotic, and exaggeration of the very mild psychoactive effects of the thujone in wormwood).

This storage feature can also be exploited when a person has an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or thyroid cancer. A common noninvasive treatment for hyperthyroidism is radioiodine therapy. 
Radioactive iodine has a relatively short half life (8 days). A patient is given a dose of meds that includes a calibrated amount of radioactive iodine particles. These will collect in the thyroid and emit their radiation to the thyroid cells slowing killing them. The dosage is calibrated to kill only a calculated percentage of the thyroid and reduce its size enough to return thyroid hormone levels to normal. The radioactive particles are only dangerous long enough to reduce the size of thyroid as needed the based on the calculations.

ydc8h6,https://www.reddit.com/user/Ungrammaticus,42,"That’s maybe a bit too simplified, and way overselling the effectiveness of iodine-pills. 
The dose you would get from a nuclear  explosion is dependent on an enormous number of different factors. What kind of explosion, weapon or reactor? Air burst or ground burst? How far away are you? What, if anything, is between you and the explosion? Can you escape the fallout? What are you wearing? Etc. etc. 
Iodine is not going to contribute much to your total dose in many, maybe most, plausible scenarios of experiencing nuclear warfare. Prompt radiation would usuallycould be a big contributor if you’re in line of sight, for example -assuming you survive the fireball, the heat, the shockwave and the debris. If it was a ground burst, the radioactive dust and micro-particles that you would be inhaling would likely be a much bigger issue. 
Your thyroid gland is also most likely pretty full of iodine already if you’re from a developed country. Most countries add it to table salt, and it doesn’t take much before your thyroid is full of it. 
Iodine pills are by no way guaranteed to help you any, and if you rely on them to protect you from the radiation from a nuclear bomb, you’re going to have a bad time. 
On the other hand, taking them isn’t dangerous and they’re fairly cheap. In specific situations where Iodine-131 is likely to contribute much of the potential dose, taking them may be a reasonable better safe than sorry approach.

But when it comes to war, it depends.  If you're in Nebraska where all those Minuteman III silos are still active, you're going to get ground bursts because they're hardened sites and you'll have a lowered life-expentancy but not nearly as much as you may think.
OTOH, if you live in costal Oregon and aren't in the direct blast, you're not going to get any sort of significant radiation or life expectancy changes.  
FWIW, the dangers have been oversold by people who have political agendas. Science is not exempt from politics and, surprisingly, it doesn't always correct itself due to social pressures even though it's supposed to be self-correcting.
Case in point over 90% of those who were under-10 that survived the direct Hiroshima blast (an airburst) are still alive as of August 28th, 2022.  Which is perfectly normal in Japan with its 81.1 (men) & 87.1 (women) year life expectancy. 
In fact, the long term Hiroshima studies (60+ years now) have found three things:

Those who got a mild dose have a life expectancy of just 3 months lower than the unexposed population due to slightly elevated cancer over expected baseline for Japan.
Those who got a high, but survivable dose, lost 1.3 years of life expectancy due slightly elevated cancer (but more than the above rate).
The children of the survivors are indistinguishable from the general population in all respects.

That's your reality.  But you don't see that.  You see the aftermath talk and the politically motivated documentaries by fear mongers. 
Hell, to be honest, if you had a coal power plant near your city back in the 1970s, you got more negative health exposure than those who survived Hiroshima.

ydc8h6,https://www.reddit.com/user/cretan_bull,11,"No, it wasn't. The effects of nuclear weapons vary with range, dictated by the inverse square law. You can play around with something like nukemap to see this for yourself.
There's a huge area where the detonation causes burns, and where putting any opaque barrier between you and it would shield you. Ideally, even a few seconds of warning would be enough to shield you completely from it, but even ducking and covering in response to a detonation would still be beneficial, since the thermal radiation isn't an instantaneous pulse: it lasts several seconds, until the fireball cools down.
In addition, you want to shield yourself from the shockwave. How long that takes to reach you depends on your distance from the detonation. The 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor is a good example of this: there were many injuries caused by shattered glass, but those who took shelter in the time before the shockwave arrived were largely unharmed.

ydc8h6,https://www.reddit.com/user/wasmic,10,"If you're very close to the nuclear bomb going off, you're just dead.
If you're far enough away to survive the shockwave, however, then closing the blinds can save you from severe and possibly life-threatening burns.
And if you're far away enough that your house remains intact, then you should absolutely tape up every single crack in your home. All around the windows, doors, ventilation chutes, etc. All of it should be covered with tape. And if you need to let someone in later, they must wipe down outdoors and leave their outermost layer of clothing behind before coming in.
There are two types of radiation from a nuclear bomb. The first is prompt radiation, which arrives instantly but is only dangerous if you have a direct line of sight to the bomb at the time of explosion. Even a book can block the prompt radiation, so even thin walls will be adequate protection. Then there's the fallout, which arrives around 5-10 minutes after the explosion, and consists of fine, radioactive dust which is dangerous to breathe. This can also potentially provide a lethal dose, but can be kept out with finely filtered masks. Airbursting nuclear weapons (used for destroying cities and military targets) only create minimal amounts of fallout, but groundbursts (used for taking out hardened bunkers and missile silos) create a huge amount of fallout. Hiroshima was an airburst, but a very low-altitude airburst, so it created a lot of fallout compared to the size of the explosion. The city, however, was generally safe again after 3 days.
If a nuclear reactor explodes, on the other hand, it will almost solely cause fallout - and a crapton of it.

So, yes: absolutely pull down the blinds. But be prepared to extinguish them if they catch fire from the nuclear flash.

If you’re exposed to a sufficient dose of radiation, you’ll get sick from it either way. The use of iodine is because one of the most dangerous components of fallout from a nuclear bombing is iodine-131, which is both highly radioactive and something which the human body readily takes in (as iodine is an essential part of the thyroid hormone thyroxin, it always concentrates as an element in the thyroid, making it pretty much an iodine sponge).
By megadosing on non-radioactive iodine, it is possible to limit the amount of iodine-131 that the thyroid absorbs, and therefore limit one of the most dangerous internal sources of radiation after being exposed to fallout.
However, if you’re around a large amount of radioactive material giving off a form of radiation that readily penetrates the human body on its own (such as gamma radiation), iodine wont do anything to protect from symptoms of exposure.

A common byproduct of nuclear fission is Iodine-131.
Most forms of radiation are not overwhelmingly dangerous to us, provided they are outside our body.
Alpha radiation causes burns like sunburns, but is otherwise blocked by clothes and our skin.
Beta radiation causes burns as well by damaging skin cells, but it does not penetrate significantly into our body. 
Neutron radiation is non-reactive and will blow right through your body. Unless it hits an atomic nucleus though (like an asteroid randomly hitting the sun), it won't damage anything. Mostly harmless. 
Gamma rays and x-rays can penetrate through skin and bone, as they are high energy electromagnetic waves (photons). These will blow right through your body until they hit an electron and then they can ionize the atom that the electron is in, causing damage on a molecular level. This is a contributing cause of cancer.
Most notably, Alpha and Beta radiation is FAR more dangerous if it's emitted from inside your body.
Inside our body, we don't have skin cells as a sacrificial barrier, and the radiation is able to directly damage our internal organs.
This is what makes Radon gas dangerous. It's a gas that emits alpha radiation, so we easily inhale it where it can damage our lungs from the inside out.
In a nuclear emission scenario, many radioactive particles make it into the air. From there they can settle in water, on crops, or be directly breathed in. One way or another, they end up in our bodies. If a radioactive metal isotope travels through our digestive system, it'll do some damage along the way, but it won't necessarily be severe, or even noticeable. If we breathe in a few radioactive particles and then breathe them right back out, the damage is often minimal.
Iodine 131 poses a specific risk to us though. Our thyroid gland uses Iodine to produce the thyroid hormone. We cannot make iodine, so our thyroid gland has to scavenge iodine from our diet and stockpile it for hormone production.
When radioactive I-131 shows up in our body (from breathing it in, or consuming foods contaminated with it), our thyroid cannot tell the difference between it and non-radioactive isotopes of iodine, and it grabs hold and stockpiles it. This causes I-131 to accumulate in our thyroid gland where it is like a continually exploding grenade emitting radioactive shrapnel into our thyroid. This iodine can be held there for considerably long periods of time, literally months.
This is where iodine tablets come in. Taking a potassium iodide tablet essentially doses your body up with excess iodine. Your thyroid gland absorbs this from your bloodstream until it's topped up and you'll pass the excess iodine in your urine. If you take a KI tablet shortly after learning about a radioactive emission incident, when your body ends up running into I-131 (through air, food, or water), your thyroid will have a ""no vacancy"" sign up and won't be absorbing any extra iodine. The I-131 isotopes will then eventually get excreted in your urine without being stored by your thyroid. The I-131 will still damage your lungs, digestive system, circulatory system, and bladder, but it's there for a day or less and the damage is often negligible.

Potassium Iodide (KI) 
Use KI Only if Instructed

Do not take KI unless you are instructed by public health or emergency response officials or a healthcare provider.  KI can cause harmful health effects. KI is helpful only in specific situations for certain groups of people.
KI should be used only as directed.
Do not use table salt or foods as a substitute for KI. They do not help with radiation poisoning and eating large amounts could be harmful.
Only use KI products that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dietary supplements that contain iodine may not work to protect the thyroid and can hurt you.
Radioactive iodine contamination is mainly associated with nuclear power plant accidents. In other types of nuclear emergencies, such as a nuclear detonation, the biggest risk is external exposure to many types of radioactive materials. It is best to shelter in place for protection.
Limits of KI Use
KI may not give a person 100% protection. KI is most effective if taken shortly before or right after internal contamination with radioactive iodine. The effectiveness of KI also depends on how much radioactive iodine gets into the body and how quickly it is absorbed in the body.
KI is only recommended for people under 40 and pregnant or breastfeeding people. People with certain medical conditionsexternal icon, including known iodine sensitivity, should not take KI or should talk to a healthcare provider about whether they can safely take KI.
KI only offers limited protection for specific situations and populations:
KI protects only against radioactive iodine and does not protect against other types of radiation.
KI protects only the thyroid. KI does not protect other parts of the body.
KI must be taken within 24 hours before or 4 hours after exposure to be most effective.
KI is not a treatment and cannot reverse damage already done to the thyroid.
KI may not give a person 100% protection from radioactive iodine.
Most radiation emergencies will involve other types of radiation and not radioactive iodine alone. Radioactive iodine is most common in nuclear power plant incidents. The best protection in a radiation emergency is always to get inside, stay inside, and stay tuned for more information from officials.

By having excess iodine in your system your body will naturally excrete any excess which will hopefully include a majority of the I-131 you are exposed to.

They never address the concepts of contamination vs radiation and dose, which is critical to understanding radiation safety.  Iodine does help if you are nearby to some sort of nuclear incident, because it protects your body from retaining internal contamination from a particular type of airborne source that is common in those scenarios, but there are many more sources of radiation to be aware of. Internal contamination is a killer because now the source of radiation is inside your body and there is no shielding, no distance, and it's there for however long the half-life is. If you want to keep it simple, your best protection from radiation sickness is, and always will be minimize exposure Time to a source/ maximize Distance from source/ maximize Shielding between you and source.  Aside from not getting exposed to a direct blast of radiation from like a bomb or a critical reactor, the real trick is to keep contamination off of you as much as possible and most definitely OUTSIDE of your body.  Doing these things will minimize your total dose. Acute radiation sickness is caused by taking a large dose in a short time. Accumulating a large dose over a long time causes cancer.

Blast radiation: Nuke goes off and lots of radiation gets produced. For most bombs this won't matter because anyone close enough to get a bad dose of radiation will either get cooked by the heat or blasted by the shock wave anyways. But, it is a consideration in a ""neutron bomb"", atas the radiation is much higher compared to the heat and blast. Iodine does nothing to help against this.
Radioactive dust: A mix of a lot of radioactive material drops in the fallout zone. If you stay in the open in the fallout zone there may be enough to kill you. If it gets on your food or water and you ingest it, the radiation from the dust can cause sickness or death. Mostly fades away to non-hazardous levels over a few weeks (but experts disagree on how much long term cancer risk will remain). Iodine tables do nothing against general fallout components.
Bio-accumulating isotopes: There are three primary radioactive materials with significant half-lives that can build up in your body over time if you live in the fallout zone. 
1 - Iodine: One is radioactive isotopes of iodine, which will last a few weeks. Taking iodine tablets can give you body so much ""clean"" iodine that isit displaces and encourages your body to flush out and of the radioactive iodine, and prevents any significant accumulation of the radioactive stuff in your body.
Strontium and cesium: The other two isotopes that can accumulate in your body over time are ones of strontium and cesium. Your body stores these just like calcium, so these can also accumulate in tissues such as bones. Iodine tablets do not do anything against these isotopes. There usually isn't enough of these produced to cause immediate radiation sickness, but these isotopes are long lasting so there is a long term risk of cancer as they accumulate in your body.

I'm definitely not a pianist, but I've taught myself (and promptly forgotten how) to play a couple of simple two-handed pieces, and I have the same difficulty you describe in controlling my hands independently.
But at least for me it's not that each hand wants to copy the other. I can play the left-hand part by itself just fine with the right hand still, and vice versa. The problem is that I have a hard time having each hand perform its task simultaneously with the other.
I play wind instruments more than piano, and I never had a problem (and never heard of any other musician having a problem) with the right and left hands doing different things because they are synchronized. You arrange both hands in a certain way to form a single note, and then articulate that note. Both hands are doing different things, but they are doing them together for a single purpose. It's giving each hand a separate independent task that causes problems, and the wires get crossed where both hands want to do one of the tasks.
Another exampleissue might be similarity between what each hand is thatdoing. whileWhile playing computer games, I have no problem controlling it with one hand on the mouse and the other on the keyboard, issuing separate commands through each device. But when I tried attaching two mice to the same computer and controlling two cursors, one with each hand? Forget about it.

I can also perceive it happening in my wrists and when I flex any muscle in my arms. 
I’ve gotten used to it, but things like playing the piano or guitar and not letting go of cups by accident were difficult as a child. Oddly enough they were also essential in learning to not fully engage the wrong side when performing an important task. Not moving my hand while writing or having my other hand slightly mirror the other while scratching are still quite annoying.
The worst part is the force of the muscle initiation on the wrong side is directly proportional to the amount of weight being exerted and it’s corresponding muscle response on the other side.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526119/#_article-20094_s1_
As others have said a lot of our sensory and motor fibers cross at decussations mostly in the medulla but cranial nerves do not. Cranial nerves do have hemispheric cross over in some cases like using CN3 for example in how eye muscles work. Although you are talking about CN7 for blinking. I encourage you to read the link I posted but for a TLDR;…..
Upper motor neurons for CN7 in the cortex talk to both dorsal and ventral portions of the contralateral facial nucleus in the pons…and the ipsilateral upper motor neuron also gets to talk to the ipsilateral dorsal portion of the facial nucleus….dorsal portion controls muscles of upper face = orbicularis muscle = allows bilateral closure of eyelids….ventral portion of facial nucleus receives innervation mainly from contralateral tracts…which controls muscles of lower face….so contralateral input only is in control of lower face….this explains why in Bell’s palsy which is an idiopathic palsy of a unilateral lower motor neuron you get a total knockout of upper and lower facial muscles….while if the upper motor neuron was the problem you would only have paresis of the contralateral lower face.
Bout as TLDR as i could make it.

Follow on question then. When we take conscious control of an autonomic function like blinking or breathing or facial control...

I have to first clarify that there's a difference between automated functions and ""autonomic"". The first place to start is the different types of nerve fibers that are classified based on whether they're general or specialized (i.e. special senses like optic, olfactory, and taste), somatic or visceral (skeletal muscle vs smooth muscle or gland), and afferent vs efferent (transporting information to or from the CNS; sensory vs motor).
When we talk about the autonomic nervous system, we're referencing visceral fibers (e.g. GVE, GVA) and visceral fibers can not be consciously controlled.
But the functions you mentioned (breathing, blinking, and facial muscle control) are all somatic (specifically GSE) and not autonomic. But many somatic functions are automated to an extent. There's a circuit in the brainstem that regulates oxygen saturation in the blood and will keep the respiratory system going at a stay rhythm to maintain, but they are skeletal muscles (diaphragm and intercostals) and they are under somatic (GSE) control. A lot of muscles, like postural muscles, have separate spinal cord tracts for the continuous automation of activating those muscles so that you don't simply fall to the floor like a rag doll when you stop thinking about standing up straight, but they're still somatic and you can re-take control at any time you choose.
You'd be surprised how many somatic functions actually require minimal conscious input. Like throwing a ball; you don't usually think about which muscles and how much to contract them and in which order when you throw a ball; you just think about throwing it and where you want it to go. Your cerebellum has the pre-scripted details on how to actually throw (and hit the target), does the internal math and modifies the base plan to hit the intended target and then it just runs that program upon request. But your comciousness doesn't need to perform all of those tasks. You just want to throw the ball. And none of that's autonomic, but it is automatic.

But that is only the first control layer. There are additional layers that control primary motor cortex, such as premotor cortex and the supplemental motor area. Their job is to help sequence and synchronize the ""twitches"" produced by primary motor cortex.
And these layers communicate with their counterparts on the other side of the brain. So for example stimulation of your left supplementalpremotor motor areacortex can produce a complex movement involving multiple muscle groups on both sides of your body.
Secondary motor control centers allow you to not only blink in sync, but also synchronize your leg muscles when jumping, your arms when clapping, etc.

ycrf85,https://www.reddit.com/user/fastspinecho,2,"You can think of primary motor cortex as a ""clickable map"" of all the muscles in your body. The map can be ""clicked"" by either side of your brain, causing that muscle to move. 
However, half of the map physically resides in one hemisphere, and the other half resides in the other hemisphere. If a hemisphere is lost, then the map is lost and a person will become hemiplegic.  This is the same reason why some people are hemiplegic after a stroke. Note that in very young children, the brain can rebuild the map in the remaining hemisphere. But it is very difficult for adults to regain function in adults.
On the other hand, a callosotomy severs some of the structures that the brain uses to reach across and click the map on the opposite hemisphere. It does not sever all thoseof the structures and methods used to transmit signalsinformation across hemispheres. For example, both hemispheres still have indirect visual and proprioceptive input regarding what is happening on the contralateral side.
So it's hard to predict what will happen, but generally it will be more difficult to coordinate movements. 
Here's what happened to one patient:

We examined bimanual coordination in a patient before and after each stage of callosotomy surgery. We tested how well the patient coordinated movement direction between the hands. The patient drew symmetrical or asymmetrical figures simultaneously with both hands. Before surgery, symmetrical figures were drawn well and asymmetrical figures were drawn poorly. Following anterior callosotomy, the drawings improved slightly. Symmetrical figures were still drawn well, and asymmetrical ones were still drawn poorly. Thus, spatial integration remained intact despite the loss of interhemispheric communication between frontal cortical sites. After posterior callosotomy, spatial coordination deteriorated significantly. Mirror-image drawings became less symmetrical, while asymmetrical drawings improved. These data indicate that the posterior callosum mediates the coordination of direction information between the hands during bimanual movements. Given the topographical organization of the corpus callosum, this integration is likely carried out by parietal cortex.

It makes your red blood cells far more resistant to being infected by the disease-causing agent, the plasmodia

It's because one of the life stages of malaria requires for the parasite to mature inside red blood cells (RBCs), before the cell bursts and all the mature parasites are released into the blood stream.
With sickle cell disease, the RBCs are more fragile and burst more easily. That means the RBCs are bursting and releasing the parasites into the blood before a lot of them are fully mature, which hurts the progression of the disease.
In the presence of two copies of the gene (one from each parent), that trait is even more pronounced and RBCs are so fragile that they're constantly bursting for no reason, which causes anemia and all sorts of body-wide problems. Day to date events like stress, high temperature or dehydration can cause them to burst en masse and cause pain attacks.
Also the name is because the RBCs are literally shaped like a sickle instead of being kind of round.

The crossed-out text was somewhat recently debunked, it looks like the plasmodia either struggles to survive in the mutant red blood cells, or the infected red blood cell is more efficiently removed from the body before it bursts with a payload of new plasmodia.

To be exact, ""sickle-cell"" is a mutation in a gene that codes for one of the proteins used to make hemoglobin. When a person is heterozygous for sickle-cell, meaning they have one normal and one sickle-cell gene, their body produces both normal AND sickle-cell hemoglobin, which results in red blood cells that sickle when the level of carbon dioxide in the blood is elevated.
The malaria parasite lives inside red blood cells, and its life cycle causes an elevated CO2 level in the affected cell, causing it to sickle. This in turn renders the cell a hostile environment for the parasite and also greatly reduces the cell's lifespan, reducing the parasite's ability to proliferate.

Just as one example: The poster children for rapid evolution are the genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). These genes are critical for T cells to recognize pathogen antigens and they change very rapidly (see for example The rise and fall of great class I genes).

Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions.

That ""genome cost"" only exists when considering the individual.

A genome is the makeup of an individual, and can only be understood as such.  Population genetics is the spread of genes but the mechanism, by necessity, acts on individuals with the genes.  Your genes could be said to 'not care about you particularly' except as a vehicle for themselves, just as your genes in you don't give a crap about 'the species' except how it impacts your personal genome.  
Not sure what you mean that evolution 'caters to the whole species'.  Its effects can only be seen in these terms but the mechanism shapes the behavior of individuals to act on their own behalf.  Sometimes this benefits the whole species, often it doesn't.  That's just selection for you.

Nope. It's statistics that matter at the species level.
A recessive gene with madsive negative consequences will statistically become more and more rare, since at an individual level people who express it are more likely to not produce offspring.
However, if you then get a sudden change in environmental conditions which massively increases those people's survival chances or chances of increasing offspring, then the portion of the population with said gene is going to jump way up again.

I also wonder about things that are fairly common and usually benign like SIgAD, or far more commonly partial IgA deficiency (PIgAD). I found one study that found a 4x odds ratio for severe Covid in SIgAD patients, but the CIs are massive, this doesn’t apply to PIgAD (generally defined as IgA levels below 2SD of the median but not below detection limits, for example if reference range bottoms out at 90mg/dL and you find 30, that’s not <5 but it’s low), and also you have the bias inherent in the fact that many SIgAD people are asymptomatic so a cohort of diagnosed SIgAD people is going to probably include mostly symptomatic cases since they’re more likely to be detected.
But PIgAD is far more common, obviously simple math dictates a low single digit or slightly below 1% rate. If this is associated wifi more severe Covid outcomes I’d wonder what can be done for those patients since IgA deficiencies can’t really be “treated” effectively and even a mucosal / nasal vaccine would not help much if their B cells are being arrested before maturing to the point of creating IgA antibodies 
Thanks for the explanation w.r.t. CD56.. I wonder what the most crucial element in the naive host is? Innate immunity wise. IgA? Can that be created quickly even if you’re immune naive? Thinking about back in 2020 how some immune naive hosts still had mild course. Or is it just that their innate immune system reacted quickly?

yo6whr,https://www.reddit.com/user/craigdahlke,24,"Was looking for this answer. The adaptive immune system, particularly antibody mediated immunity is almost like very short term evolution that happens in the span of weeks inside of an organism. Antibodies are produced in B-cells virtually at-random through a process called VDJ recombination, in which the immune cells randomly combine various genes to produce antibodies with different paratopes (the regions of antibodies that recognize pathogens). When a B-cell receptor (which is essentially a membrane-bound antibody) recognizes a pathogen, that B-cell is then signaled to proliferate and mature into a plasma cell. These new progeny of the B-cells that recognized the pathogen undergo yet another “evolution” in which the antibody encoding region undergoes what is called somatic hypermutation, again a random process that either makes the antibody more or less specific, and in the latter former case gives feedback to the highly specific plasma cells to further proliferate and keep flooding the body with antibodies until no more pathogen is found to continue the process. This of course is only one part of it, there is also isotype switching, in which the specificity of the antibody remains the same, but the class of antibody changes, which allows it to interact with different arms of the immune system to eliminate pathogens through different channels. There is also T-cell immunity which I believe happens through somewhat similar mutation methods, except that antibodies are not directly involved.

Every first world country except America negotiates drug prices. They look at the costs to produce it, money spent on r&d and come up with a reasonable figure where the medical supply company is still making a healthy margin.

That's not quite the whole picture. 
Currently drugs cost around $1-3 billion from benchtop to FDA approval. So yes, if you charged $3 billion for that first dose, every other one is just cost of manufacturing, but depending on some compound (like biologics, manufacturing is actually quite expensive). 
However that's not how it works. A drug company gets very little time 'on market' to make their drug before generics can come in (10 years or now often less). 
So say we get 10 years are best to make back that $3 billion with zero profit.  If we sell a million doses a year, each shot is $300 just to break even. 
The moment a generic manufacturer can come in, your ability to 'recoup' the investment is essentially zero. 
Vaccines are exceptionally tricky, unless you are selling them to governments, people will not buy them at the cost it took to make them or the vaccine is often a one time injection instead of a lifetime of pills. 
Socialized medicine often means for somethings negotiation can happen, when there are alternatives available, or buying power, however with the case of things like vaccines, usually governments pay 'full price' and you pay very little, (except you are actually paying for it with your taxes).

Its also why drug treatments for conditions like alzheimers, parkisons, and other conditions go soooo slow. They are almost entirely dependent on charity and underfunded government grants.
Covid is the extreme example because the world backed up the brinks truck to fund it, and boom, solved it nearly instantly.
If you could tell a drug company heres 10b create a vaccine for literally anything... they could.

yere7r,https://www.reddit.com/user/kyo20,14,"Aside from the ""profit, money"" part, the rest of what you wrote is basically false. Most of the major drugmakers' business relies on novel molecules, that is where the money is. Anyone involved in the drugmaking business knows this.
You don't get a new patent or regulatory exclusivity when you combine two off-patent drugs (unless you can create a novel delivery mechanism that is superior to just taking the two drugs together; this is not easy to do, and init would need to go through clinical trials and apply for regulatory approval). In general there is no financial incentive for drugmakers to explore such combinations. Doctors and researchers will still look for these cost-effective combinations, but profit-driven drugmakers will not.
(Perhaps you're thinking of drug compounding, which does combine off-patent drugs. This is done by pharmacies, andnot drugmakers. It is not reallyvery aprofitable bigcompared profitto generator.novel Thisdrug isdevelopment, entirelyand separateit fromalso thedoesn't drugmakingusually industryinvolve any patents.)
It is true that drugmakers will often test drugs in combination, especially in oncology space where many of the newnovel drugs are part of a combination regimen. But at least one of the agents will be novel -- otherwise there wouldn't be any financial incentive (as noted above).! These combinations must undergo clinical trials and file for regulatory approval, the same way a new drug used as a monotherapy would, and are very expensive to run (usually more expensive than a monotherapy trial).
New vaccines don't happen because the main buyer of vaccines is usually governments (oftensometimes the gov'ts of developing countries) rather than US commercial insurers, and therefore profitability is low. Also, many of the diseases that might be amenable to vaccination are very complex and our scientific understanding is not that good. HIV, Dengue, etc have complex biology with features that make vaccination extremely challenging. Another major, major issue is that we as humans are often not willing to pay much for preventative measures like vaccines; by contrast, we are willing to pay exorbitant amounts when s*** hits the fan and we or our loved ones are at imminent risk of dying (one of the reasons why cancer treatments can command such high prices, even ones with limited benefit). We often say ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"", but in reality, society does not set the price of medicines based on this adage.
As for antibiotics, the reason why we don't see many new ones is because there just isn't that much unmet medical need there. We've got antifungals and antibacterials, for the vast majority of patients they work. For cases that are refractory to first line treatments, we usually have second line treatments as well. Diseases that don't have large unmet medical need aren't going to be highly profitable.
Your take on neuroscience drugs is completely wrong. Dementia (such as for Alzheimer's disease, or AZD) has largehuge unmet medical need, and therefore this space has MASSIVE profit potential. These diseases are devastating to the patient and their caregivers -- I really cannot describe it in words, you need to hear testimonials to really comprehend the depth of despair that AZD can cause -- and are also a very large burden on the healthcare system. I think the potential market space for a good AZD drug can be as big as any treament for a cancer, an autoimmune disease, or a metabolic disease. The financial incentive to find treatments for dementia cannot be understated. However, development is slow because our scientific understanding of the brain simply is not very good. Moreover, many drugmakers, biotech companies, and investors have been burned badly by failures in the past. Why pour money or a lifetime of research effort into this disease when so many other promising companies and genius scientists have failed? On the bright side, recently there has been some limited regulatory success in the AZD space due to amyloid-beta drugs (AB), but we're still in the early stage of understanding this class of drugs, and so far the one approved drug (aducanumab) has not been commercially successful and its clinical data so far has not that convincing.

Like that 60s formaldehyde inactivated one. Which had the body produce non neutralizing antibodies in mass. Meaning upon a real infection, the immune system was busy producing useless antibodies, and could not produce the neutralizing ones, because it ‚thought‘ that it already knew the virus.
Leading to a massive increase in mortality in those given the vaccine when they contracted RSV, and also a massive increase in contracting it in itself.
Same with HIV. It‘s not like there haven’t been attempts by every large Pharma company as well as a shitlod of startups.

It had to be given once a month and each time insurance fought us trying to deny coverage. On top of that, our regular pediatrician’s office did not administer it, so we had to go to a completely different doctor in another city solely for the vaccine. Which of course, insurance liked even less.

Antibodies are far more easy to make but also much more expensive and less effective.
They only make up a part of the immune response to an infection/vaccine, but you can find ones that work pretty easily in vitro.
But they are more costly to produce than a vaccine in general, and since they only last about a month in the blood stream, there‘s really no wide spread market for them.
They are used in patients with extreme risk factors, everyone else has to wait for a vaccine, that gives a more robust reponse.

It also isn’t something that got massive funding and approval by every major nation on the planet.

This is what most people don’t understand. COVID vaccines received massive funding in an extremely short period of time which allowed for massively parallel research and unprecedented allowances for collaboration all at once.  I’d argue most vaccines receive a small fraction of the amount of what was spent on COVID - and that’s typically over decades. 
Emergency Use authorizations aside - most vaccine/drug research could happen very quickly. It doesn’t necessarily take decades of research to conduct research. The problem more often is money. The typical scenario in research is you work 3 months, you spend another 3 months drafting the report; then another 6-8 months to drum up another pile of cash to further research. If human subjects are involved the you add NIH mandated IRB (internal review board) which is time consuming without progress. Many groups are working on multiple research programs concurrently because of this, time slicing project to project. 
The rather large demographic of people that were scared of the rapid development of COVID vaccines (which really weren’t that rapid - over 2 decades of related work that alarmists ignored - but I digress). The reality is there was more scrutiny of these vaccines than probably any other vaccine that’s in use over the course of history. Effectively if you’re an anti-COVID-vaxxer because of the speed it was developed - you’re just plain ignorant; no easy way to put it.

Developing drugs takes a lot of money, for staff, equipment, raw materials, clinical trials, data analysis and so on.
I work in a related field (biotechnology and gene therapies) and worked on one of the COVID vaccines, the machines used in manufacture have eye-watering price tags. For example, in my current job we have a machine we’ll use once per batch, for <8 hours; the batch runs for about 3ish months.
This machine costs £100,000. That’s just the hardware, software is another chunk, the tubing is another chunk, reagents etc.
For one day of processing.
One of the freezer’s we use is between about £400,000 to £600,000.
This is one facility, making 3 (ish) batches a year.
And that’s just manufacturing.
Before it even gets there it goes through several years of process development, research, analytics. Then finally clinical trials (except research, analytics and PD continue to optimise and improve the process. Then eventually into actual commercial batches which is the first point a company starts to actually make money.
That ignores that in clean rooms the energy bill for all the HVACs, pumps, lights, electricity for machines can cost up to 80% of a facility’s operating budget per year.
Then add in staff, support departments like QA, QC, MSAT, engineering, facilities, IT, health and safety, security, receptionists, HR, finance, business development (to actually get you investment to do all the above).
And in pharmaceutical drug development (not my field but related) the approval rate of new drugs is like 10-20%. So to develop one new drug you need to (on average so obviously not true in every individual case) develop 5-10 drugs to make one successfully approved medicine. These fail for a variety of reasons but the take home is that the cost of 4-9 other drugs have to be made up for with each successful drug.
The upside of the pandemic was massive amounts of funding into COVID vaccines, so a lot of things were made faster/easier. 
Companies were able to take risks on new drugs because the cost wasn’t solely on them if/when a candidate failed. 
Scale up of research, development and analytics allowed more experiments to be run at a time, on more machines, reducing development time where experiments are usually gated by reward vs time and money cost and have to be performed when you have sufficient material, free equipment, staff.
Scale up of manufacturing was possible because you could purchase the machines and validate them in tandem with development due to the extra funds.
There’s only so much money to go around, so unless something (like a pandemic) focuses that investment, throwing more money at the problem isn’t always possible.

not all states have accepted Obamacare as it is known 

The Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) is mostly not optional for States, FWIW. The optional component is a Medicaid expansion: a plan that offers States increased Medicaid (public insurance for low-income households) funding if the States agree to cover more people by raising the income limits for qualification.
Some states choose not to accept that; in some cases it's purely political, in some cases there are legitimate concerns about increased costs for the State.

It’s absurd. It uses its own reverse transcriptase to turn RNA -> DNA (because the host cell doesn’t die that naturally), and the virus has not evolved to be precise and accurate. 
Of course, then you have foreign DNA in your cells, and your native DNA editing machinery pokes around making changes too. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4574155/ 
End result? Each and every new virus is likely as not to have a mutation. 
Factor in the high mutation rate with the short times between generations (and the MASSIVE number of new individuals in each generation) and it’s easy to see why it’s hard to make a vaccine.
The damn virus mutates faster than we can design and test a vaccine.

HIV mutates fast. And I mean FAST. It translates RNA -> DNA and then back to RNA. It brings its own reverse transcriptase machinery -- which did not evolve to avoid all mutations.
And then your cell's own machinery sees this foreign DNA -- and makes some edits too. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4574155/ 
The result of all this is that (roughly) each new HIV virus is as likely to have a mutation as not. 
Combine that mutation rate with the rapid pace of new generations and the ABSURD number of new individuals in each generation, and it quickly becomes apparent why making a vaccine is hard. 
The virus mutates faster than we can develop and test a vaccine.  The traditional methods just don't work.

yere7r,https://www.reddit.com/user/NatAttack3000,1,"Making a vaccine that induces an immune response isn't hard to 'figure out' - you take a unique antigen (molecular part, usually a protein or something encoding a protein) and administer it with a substance that will attract an immune response. It's not like 'eureka, I didn't realise i needed to add eye of newt', you know it's basically going to have the same basic parts but it's actually that we don't know how to get a good immune response without causing problems in a lot of cases. So how do we tweak it.
In the case of HIV, you can get an immune response but HIV then hides from the immune response. In the case of RSV, previous vaccines could get an immune response but in babies it was either not very protective, or it lead to antibodies that actually made their RSV worse when they contracted it.
Considering RSV isn't a risk for healthy adults, and at risk babies are often isolated anyway, no one is rolling out a vaccine for rsv with a small chance that the vaccine would actually make some babies worse. So they relied on 'safer' options like monoclonal antibody therapies.
In the years since we are learning more about what makes a helpful vs harmful immune response so I think we will get a vaccine that doesn't have those bad effects.

Posted September 8, 2021
https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/Another-HIV-vaccine-fails-highlighting/99/web/2021/09

At the root of the frustration is a virus that has survived in the most head-scratching way possible—by being sloppy.
When HIV copies itself inside a human cell, it has no mechanism to proofread its genetic information, says Warner Greene, director of the Gladstone Institutes’ Michael Hulton Center for HIV Cure Research. This means that as the virus replicates, it accumulates tiny mutations that don’t necessarily affect its function but do affect the way the immune system can recognize it. One person can have several HIV variants circulating in their body all at once.
“The virus is a swarm,” Greene says. “It’s not a species, it’s a swarm of different variants.”



On top of this carelessness-as-survival-mechanism, HIV infects the very immune cells that would normally help clear a virus. The antibodies a person makes in short-term response to infection don’t block HIV infection—they aren’t neutralizing. And what are called broadly neutralizing antibodies, which can block many variants from entering cells, can take years for the body to develop, Greene says.
This is why some vaccine candidates, like Moderna’s, are trying to coax out those broadly neutralizing antibodies sooner, he says.

You can add it to an embryo and have these DNA sequences integrate at specific sites by making the DNA sequence the same as where you want it integrated because every strand of DNA has a complement. You can then cause specific mutations at these sites as an embryo or even in a way you can trigger with chemicals so that the mutation can be triggered at any time at specific tissues.

Isn't it possible that most cancers are transmissible given the right scenario? 

Such a cancer would have to be able to survive exposure during the transmission process while also being in the right place and condition to transfer to a susceptible host site.
Once there, the immune system would almost certainly kill the more foreign looking cancer, as it almost always does for the more similar looking native cancers that arise in the host. But if it can evade the immune system, or if the immune system were missing, then it would have to find a suitable site and then maybe it can take hold. 
So there would be a lot stacked against most cancers.

yt84g7,https://www.reddit.com/user/Chiperoni,2,"To Crispr edit you need two things. One is an enzyme known as Cas. Cas’ job is to cut DNA. The other is a piece of DNA you manufacture.  In the simplest terms, one piece of the dna binds Cas and the other binds the DNA of the target. When you combine both parts you create a little homing missile that binds the target so that Cas can make a cut. Now there’s a whole bunch of neat tricks you can do but the simplest are either to make a mutation or add DNA. 
Just by having Cas at the target, the DNA will keep getting cut and the cell will repair it. Until it doesn’t because it makes an error. Then because your manufactured DNA doesn’t match the target perfectly it dissociates and Cas stops cutting. Now you have a missense, silent, frameshift, deletion, or nonsense mutation.
Alternatively, while Cas cuts you can also add more DNA that matches the DNA around the target with the hope that when the cell repairs the DNA and that this new DNA sneaks in. Now you have an insertion.
Again lots of little tricks you can do. For example let’s say you want to mutate a protein important in heart muscle. You can literally use CRISPR to insert an artificial gene that is only expressed in the heart by sticking close to a gene sequence that is only expressed in heart. Then you can actually CRISPR in the Cas protein but in a way that it’s only turned on when exposed to a chemical like the chemo drug tamoxifen. So you can grow normal mice and then at whatever point you like expose them to tamoxifen which turns on Cas. This Cas will then only have an effect on your original gene target only in the heart because the artificial DNA sequence you added is only expressed there. Really the possibilities are endless.

I have seen little lab-based primate research save for some small specialty fields in neuroscience like grabbing stuff and chit-chatting fine motor coordination and language acquisition. Even then, the research is on very small primates like macaques. Thinking practically, feeding thousands of giant apes every day just waiting for one to get breast cancer sounds very expensive and very boring.   
The typical procedure for cancer research is to either mutate a mouse and breed them or to inject a human tumor seed into the mouse, causing the animal to get cancer. These processes are have been very well-described in other comments. I would like to add that in neuroscience we use a more diverse range of animals in the lab, but also many researchers go out in the field and observe animals in the wild. Studies on things like tool usage and language acquisition are in fact conducted by watching animals (usually dozens not thousands) and seeing what they do. We save money by having them–and sadly, sometimes the researchers–forage for their own food.  
I will say that you have pointed out a systematic flaw with biomedical research, which is that researchers have a much easier time studying a disease caused by particular mutation(s) than one with a more complex etiology. It is much simpler (and cheaper) to make a mouse model that has a BRCA1 cancer or some other genetic disease (e.g. Huntington's) than a disease that is complicated and hard-to-measure (e.g. Major Depressive Disorder), so research funding tends to gravitate towards these projects, even if the diseases they study impact many fewer people.

Some ways are genetic, some environmental, some through selective breeding, some through nutrition, and many other ways. Most animal research however doesn’t use primates (aside from humans). Mice are often the go to for mammalian research. Their genome is well understood and relatively easily modifiable. For instance, we can modify a gene that makes them less sensitive to insulin and thereby they effectively have type II diabetes. Sometimes some animals naturally have genetic abnormalities that make them good animal models for human diseases. Golden retrievers actually experience something very similar to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and through selective breeding, a colony of dystrophic dogs was managed to study the impacts of treatments that might be viable for humans. Sometimes we also find animals in the wild too.

yt84g7,https://www.reddit.com/user/DrFredCancerRandD,1,"As a physician-scientist have been involved in preclinical drug discovery and clinical development Phase I-III oncology therapeutics for over 30 years - this is an important question. The field as evolved considerably largely because of deeper understanding of human cancer biology, pharmacology, genomics/gene expression, improved treatments, innovations in medicinal and biological chemistry, and the development of better laboratory testing methods and models. It is clear that the development and use of increasingly correlated and relevant animal models and preclinical testing are essential for advancing new discoveries in cancer therapeutics in immuno-oncology, targeted therapies, cytotoxic therapies, and others (eg., agonists, cytokine modulation, and overcoming drug resistance in various forms).
We don't use or rely on primates for drug discovery very much at all - almost exclusively now only for relevant species (most commonly cynomolgus monkeys; chimpanzees are no longer allowed for many years now) to human PK/PD safety, starting dose/dose-range testing of investigational new drugs in certain settings.
The vast majority of testing and model systems involve patient derived xenografts (PDX) which intrisically have heterogenous tumor cell populations, and human cell-line derived xenograft human tumors (CDX) that are used for in vitro and in vivo testing. Most PDX and CDX testing for antitumor efficacy and PK/PD are conducted in certain strains of immuno-deficient mice, and some cases rodents.
It would be highly impractical to sit, monitor and wait for tumors to spontaneously arise in primates (or in other species) for cancer drug treatment research - one would have to monitor these animals for new tumors all the time (eg., screening, CT/MRI scanning, biomarker testing for months or years) which would take too much time and be very costly to perform. The other problem is that non-human primate tumors, as well as murine/rodent and canine tumors are not genetically and biologically the same as human tumors. So, there is a significant limitation in testing these types of tumors and the results would not transfer well to humans with cancer. The other consideration is that primate studies are very expensive to conduct - so we use them very carefully and on a limited and very focused basis to arrive at safe starting doses, identify the safe dose range, and preliminary PK/PD profile for human studies of investigational cancer therapies.
There are much better methods that have been developed in the last 30+ years for this purpose. The big issue/caveat with any animal testing is that the testing in the lab does not always correlate 1:1 with humans, in fact it's only a highly variable partial correlation in most cases (more than 95% of the time), but in recent years much has been discovered that help to close this gap somewhat further - particularly in the immuno-oncology and targeted therapy fields. There are more sophisticated methods and models that have been developed and are used.
One major factor driving all of this focus on better animal and laboratory models and testing methods in new cancer drug research and development is that survival outcomes for the most common types of cancer has significantly improved in the past 30 years. The cancer death rate for men and women combined fell 32% from its peak incidence in the US in 1991 to 2019. So now, we are working on the harder to treat cancers. Please see Cancer Statistics 2022 from the American Cancer Society and look at the mortality reductions in 1991 to 2019 in the US in the most common cancer types.
Another major factor driving the underlying science and methods for laboratory testing in new cancer drug development is the fact that the evolution of and advances in cancer treatment are very rapid - as well as the understanding of tumor biology is deepening further every day.  The lab testing and animal systems we used 5 or 10 years ago would not be capable of identifying new and better drugs today.  These areas concommitantly and exponentially have driven the demand for more predictive animal models and testing methods; particularly in the last 8-10 years.
What we do today with relevant animal models and testing systems for generally approaching new cancer drug discovery involves a primary focus on discovering and targeting new biologic/molecular targets that control cancer cell behavior - eg., abnormal proliferation/growth, resistance to drug-mediated apoptosis, resistance to drug treatment (many different types) - especially resistance to immune mediated cell killing, metastatic behavior, reducing cancer drug resistance and driver mutations, etc. At a fundamental level, today we look at gene regulation and expression levels to do all of this, since this information is what gives us a genomic tumor signature to work with as well as a means to prove a new drug modifies, normalizes or kills the abnormal signature cell population. To do this, we start in the lab with human cancer genomic expression information and identify when the correlation between the target's presence in a cancer cell type/disease population is over expressed, and how the target of interest operates mechanistically in terms of regulating the cancer cell population's biology and how it can be targeted in best mode for maximal effect and maximal safety/tolerabiltiy (eg., monoclonal antibody, ADC, small molecule, bispecific antibody, CAR-T, CRISPR/gene editing, other cell therapy, etc.).
The selected mode of therapy (any of the foregoing areas above - antibodies, small molecules, bispecifics, BiTEs, CAR-T, CRISPR, etc. - which govern/control the route and schedule of administration) is tested in the laboratory in vitro and in vivo in relevant (partially or fully humanized) test systems and animal models using human tumor cell lines or human tumors from patients, eg., CDX and PDX models. Some animal models (particularly in mice) involve the use of human ""knock-in"" (gene insertion) and ""knock-out"" (eg., target gene or immediate proximity partner gene(s) deletion) to investigate and determine the relevance and precision of a specific target and it's downstream pharmacodynamic effects.  CRISPR and CAR-T both involve cellular reprogramming the immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells by either genetic recombination/alteration of the abnormal genome (CRISPR) or by using tumor antigen recognition and T-cell (and in some cases NK reprogramming and stimulation).
These testing methods and systems play an important role in the discovery and development of new innovations in cancer treatment because the older systems would miss the critical newly discovered elements in cancer biology that are oncogenic drivers and/or resistance factors to current treatment.  What we can do now in the lab has a huge impact on clinical development to better exploit the science for the benefit of patients.
There are many other factors to consider in the discovery and development of new cancer treatment involving complex biology, chemistry, formulation, drug delivery, safety and tolerability, pharmacology (the sum total time- and dose-dependent behavior of absorbtion, distribution, metabolism and elimination of a drug and its metabolite(s)), optimal dosing, and identifying which patients will benefit the most from such therapy.

If we consider global estimations of canopy height (i.e., how tall trees are) as presented in any number of publications (e.g., Simard et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2015, Lang et al., 2022), we can see some broad latitudinal patterns in average canopy heights, but (as well illustrated by the graphical abstract figure of Lang) these are not simple, especially if you consider the maximums, i.e., mean heights generally peak around the equator, but max heights are actually greater in the mid-latitudes and there are local differences in mean (like those in the southern mid-latitudes) that approach the means seen in the equatorial regions. Probably the most directrelevant answer comes in the Zhang et al., 2015 paper, which directly addresses latitudinal patterns, i.e., that they exist and generally suggest a decrease away from the equator, but (1) highlight there is a lot of variability in this and (2) the patterns that do exist largely reflect changes in water-energy details, i.e., how much precipitation vs potential and actual evapotranspiration occurs. Thus, generally, average wind speeds are not really a huge factor in this, though generally, average wind speed does factor into some calculations of potential evapotranspiration, but again more in the sense of changing the water balance through evaporationevaporative potential (and things like mean annual temperature, etc are going to generally be a larger factor), not through a direct wind forced cap on the height of trees.

yd5wo0,https://www.reddit.com/user/Delukse,2,"I think it's important to realize that tallest trees require several hundred to thousands of years to grow, so the trees that stand today have not only had the optimal conditions, but also stood the test of time, meaning wildfires, tsunamis, earthquakes, human encroachment and other cataclysmic events. It's likely that forests that could be tallest alive today may have been cut down 500 yrs ago and the potential to grow back lost forever. So if a scientist who wants to test conditions which would result in the tallest trees, the tree they plant today is basically going to grow in a hail of bullets from that moment on. In the sense of repeatability it's virtually impossible to create absolute optimal conditions to test the growth patterns of an organism that requires thousands of years and a complex, relatively stable ecosystem to survive.
Yet the oldest trees are not the tallest either. Many trees will not get tall if they're not surrounded by other trees. So right away you can see there's a sequence of ""spacing"" and ""competition"" while forests, after all, are also codependent/mutualists that exchange nutrients between species through mycorrhizal networks. Characteristics of trees (such as size) are a result of several adaptive, interconnected processes all of which we may not even be aware of yet. 
For example, our anthropocentric sense of time would have great difficulty understanding successive processes that an old-growth forest requires to create conditions for giant trees to emerge. You may need to have a several hundred year old forest grow to climax height, eventually die tree by tree of ""old age"", become massive repertoire for micro- and macrofauna and flora in order to create a local climate and water+nutrient cycle that is prerequisite for certain trees to finally break the existing canopy and get really, really tall and old. Watching paint dry and eventually peel off can only begin to describe the time required for these natural processes, while all we can see now is bunch of trees as if they're the final product.

ygfptx,https://www.reddit.com/user/Aseyhe,534,"Since they are both subject to the same gravitational forces, dark and ordinary matter at the same location orbit at similar average speeds, on average. However, dark matter has a much broader distribution of velocities, both in magnitude and direction.
Basically, ordinary matter is able to cool via inelastic collisions, causing it to lose energy but not angular momentum. Thus it tends to settle into configurations that reduce the ratio of energy to angular momentum, like disks. Note that collisions alone don't suffice for this; energy loss is needed. Within a disk, particles have largely coherent velocities with only a small spread. For example, material within our section of the disk orbits at roughly 220 km/s, but its velocity dispersion is only in the tens of km/s. (The velocity dispersion is the root-mean-squared deviation from the average velocity.)
In contrast, dark matter has no coherent motion, instead moving in random directions with a wide spread of speeds. The local dark matter velocity dispersion is something like 270 km/s.
(It should be noted, though, that many galaxies don't have disks. Only gas cools; stars are essentially collisionless, just like dark matter. So for example, if a galaxy's mass gets significantly redistributed, perhaps due to a merger, after it has converted its gas into stars, then the stars will not reform a disk.)

cold dark matter
warm dark matter
fuzzy dark matter (which is so light that quantum effects are important)
primordial black holes or other massive objects
self-interacting dark matter (with elastic collisions)

There are, however, ""dissipative"" dark matter models that are capable of losing energy through inelastic collisions. In those models, there would be a tendency to form disks over very long time scales. Since we know that dark matter halos are much more broadly extended than galaxies, the time scale for dark disk formation must be a lot longer than the time scale to form galactic disks, though.
Also, a dark matter particle that has a significant nongravitational interaction with ordinary matter could be dragged along with the disk. It's hard to reconcile this possibility with (1) absence of dark matter direct detection and (2) absence of dark matter creation in colliders, though.

Dark matter has never been directly observed, ...

I'd like to point out here that the known neutrinos qualify as (hot) dark matter, and other than their very light mass / relativistic speeds, they have essentially identical properties to the cold dark matter that we haven't yet directly observed.  So from a definitions standpoint, we have in fact directly observed a form of dark matter (and we regularly produce it in labs for the purpose of studying it).  The reason I mention this fact is because people seem to have a common misconception that dark matter is some kind of farfetched, esoteric hypothesis that makes it different from everything that we actually do know, when the reality is that it's incredibly similar to some of the things that we do already definitely know — so similar in fact that one of the leading hypotheses for a cold dark matter particle candidate is in fact a heavy neutrino.

... to my knowledge there isn't even strong evidence of where its located. So the certainty of statements like ""dark matter has no coherent motion"" I think needs some caveats.

I'd now also like to point out just how overwhelming the evidence for dark matter is.  Contrary to what you've said, we do in fact have multiple ways to measure the bulk properties and behavior of dark matter with enough sensitivity to narrow in on its locations, densities, velocity distribution, speed distribution, etc.  This sort of evidence comes from about a dozen completely independent metrics:

Galaxy rotation curves
Velocity dispersions of stars in galaxies
Gravitational lensing and microlensing surveys
X-ray spectra from gas-heavy galaxy clusters
The angular power spectrum of the CMB
The matter power spectrum and rates of structure formation in the early universe
Observations of more than a dozen colliding galaxy clusters, including the Bullet Cluster, Abell 520, NGC 1052-DF2, and many others
Reconciling type Ia supernova distance measurements with the observed flatness of the universe's shape
Galaxy redshift surveys
Spectral measurements of the Lyman-Alpha forest for distant galaxies

... and there are even more things not mentioned in this list as well.  What really drives the nail home is that all of these completely independent metrics are all in close agreement as to exactly how much dark matter there is, how it is distributed, and what most all of its bulk properties and behavior are.  When you have such a wealth of evidence where all of it is unequivocably pointing toward the same explanation ... there's just no reasonable excuse to deny it.
It may be true that we haven't directly detected individual cold dark matter particles, but that doesn't mean we haven't detected the effectsdirect consequences of the existence of cold dark matter in bulk.  The various observational signals supporting the existence of cold dark matter are clear, robust, and all consistent with each other.  Among honest researchers as well as honest laypeople who have an interest in science, there really can be no doubt that dark matter exists and has all of the properties that we've undisputably discovered it to have.
Edit: think about it like this.  Many hundreds of years ago, people didn't know what the mechanism underlying fire was.  Some people postulated the existence of a light, flammable fluid inside most forms of matter called phlogiston; others sought out different alchemic explanations.  At the time, nobody knew what fire actually was at a microscopic level; they didn't know about oxygen, combusion, or chemistry in general.  But do you think anybody working on the problem at the time would have denied the existence of fire?  Of course not — all you had to do was rub some sticks together to prove that fire clearly existed!  You don't need to have a microscopic understanding of fire in order to know with certainty that fire exists, because you can clearly see the bulk behavior of fire with your own eyes.  The situation is similar with dark matter, today:  we may not know what its microscopic description is yet, but we can see the macroscopic evidence very clearly with our various telescopes and instruments that are designed for making precision measurements of the cosmos.  The evidence we see for dark matter's existence is quite clear and undeniable.

At relative rest with respect to what?  Remember ... all speeds are relative to other things!  :)

... and there was an earth-mass chunk of dark matter that wandered into our path, ...

Dark matter doesn't really clump up the way ordinary matter does.  The only way you would get this is if dark matter happens to be in the form of ""MACHOs"" (massive compact halo objects) such as black holes, but that hypothesis has almost been completely ruled out except for a narrow range of masses that excludes things aroundanywhere near the Earth's mass.  So, this just isn't an actual possibility, I'm afraid!

... does that mean we would suddenly find ourselves falling toward it for seemingly no reason?

We would feel itits gravitational effects, yes.  If you had something like an Earth-mass MACHO, it could do things like disrupt orbits, to the extent that something of Earth mass can do so (naturally something like the Sun or Jupiter wouldn't be significantly affected, but smaller planets would).

I'm assuming we haven't observed dark matter at smaller than galactic scales, but I'm wondering if the current theories and observations allow for smaller amounts as well.

Unfortunately, not really ... at least, not also in grouped clumps that are within a few orders of magnitude of the Earth's mass.  You can have smaller amounts if it is very diffuse (like axions or neutrinos or some other particulate form that doesn't interact electromagnetically) but not if it clumps up due to an interaction of some kind.

Can we run into planet-sized bits of dark matter just like we can run into planet-sized primordial black holes?

That's a hard no, unfortunately.  The observational evidence (at least that which I am aware of) excludes as a form of dark matter MACHOs including primordial black holes in the mass range of 10-8 Earth masses or higher. [1]]

One of the theories is that we haven't observed a 9th planet in the solar system that's shepherding things because it may actually be a primordial black hole... Could it also be a small bit of dark matter?

It and things like it couldn't be a significant form of dark matter, no.  I don't see why it couldn't be a black hole though, whether primordial or otherwise.

Also it wasn't ""nearly consensus"" that etheraether existed, there was quite a lot of debate all throughout that period as to whether light was a wave (one that travelled in a presumed medium — an aether of some sort) or whether light was a particle or ""corpuscule"" (and hence a form of matter that did not require a medium within which to propagate).  Various people proposed either/both wave- or particle-based theories of light and experiments continued to both confirm and refute aspects of each proposed model, all the way from their inception into the early 20th century.  The problems with both kinds of models only really began to start being resolved with the advent of early quantum mechanics and the emergence of wave-particle duality as a feature in physics.
With the dark matter situation however, you have dozens of kinds of observations that are all in general agreement about dark matter, while those same observations are largely contradicted by the predictions of modified-gravity models.  Unlike with the aether, this isn't a situation ofwhere ""nobody's- model- fits- all- the- data,""; with dark matter there is a clear matter-based model that does fit all of the data, and then a bunch of alteranativealternative models that don't.

ygfptx,https://www.reddit.com/user/forte2718,11,"Uhhh ... it's been happening for basically as long as we've known dark matter existed?  The first real evidence for dark matter started coming in almost 100 years ago, in the 1930s and 1940s.  The earliest dark matter models were overly simple — just treating galaxies as if they had extra mass — and they had various problems.  Throughout the following decades, models of the cosmos became increasingly sophisticated ... and increasingly conflicted, as every model had some seemingly irreconcilable problems (regardless of dark matter) so it wasn't clear which model was the correct, or even the closest to correct.  As I understand it, during the early 1980s, the first modern models of dark matter were proposed, with distributions not matching those of baryonic matter.  And with the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe and the need for a cosmological constant or some other form of dark energy, in the late 1980s / early 1990s, enough evidence had come in for cosmologists to hone in on a model that resolved all the issues with the previous competing models — this model is known the Lambda-CDM model (lambda is the symbol for the cosmological constant term in the Einstein field equations, and CDM stands for ""cold dark matter""); it is also known as the ""concordance model"" because it gracefully resolved all the outstanding problems with the previous models of cosmology, and fit the data much better than any of those other models.  Since that time, this model has become known as the ""standard model of cosmology"" and has stood out as effectively the only model that actually works and fits all of the data.  Dark matter has been a part of that model since its inception in the early 90s, and in the three decades since all sorts of tweaks, additions, and parameterizations of that model (including its dark matter aspect) have been explored ... as well as many alternative models, none of which have panned out and found success at fitting all of the data well.
So in short, dark matter has been an accepted part of the modern model of cosmology for at least 3 decades and we've had all manners of more complicated models (and attempts at alternative models) developed during that time.  All sorts of supercomputing simulations of structure formation in the cosmos have been run and their statistics compared to observational datasets, with gradual refinement of the narrower strokes as new data has come in from missions like WMAP and the Planck spacecraft.
So, inIn summary, it's been happening this entire time because that's what cosmologists do — that's their job.  It's not like they've been slacking off for half a century; there are tens of thousands of cosmologists and astrophysicists worldwide who have been working on it doing formal research and experimentation/observation for their entire professional careers. :)

scalar field models, like the Higgs field
vector field models, like electromagnetism and the strong and weak interactions
tensor field models, like general relativity and modifications of it
supersymmetric matter models

These, together with ordinary matter models, are exhaustive of what the allowed possibilities are, at least for particle forms of dark matter (keeping in mind that aggregate forms, such as black holes and other MACHOs, have also been largely ruled out except for within a range of very small masses).  There are also combinations of these, such as TeVeS (which gets its name from combining tensor, vector, and scalar fields).
To date, the only types of models that have succeeded at explaining all of the observational evidence are matter-based models (and possibly some of the more contrived supersymmetric matter models, I am not super familiar with those but I assume they operate similarly to matter models — what I do know is that the most minimal supersymmetric models have been observationally ruled out and to date there remains zero evidence for supersymmetry in nature ... though not for lack of trying; discovering supersymmetric particles was one of the goals of the LHC, as well as other experiments).
So, it's not so much an assumption, so much as ""we've explored all of the other possibilities and this is the only possibility that actually works.""
XKCD wrote a comic about this.  There seems to be this popular misconception that we just assumed it was matter because that's simple.  No, we ""assume"" it is matter because virtually every other possibility has been heavily explored and every single one of them has failed to fit all the data even in the most contrived circumstances.  Dark matter is really the only game in town, it is the only model of all the thousands that have been explored which fits all of the data.

Basically, ordinary matter is able to cool via inelastic collisions, causing it to lose energy but not angular momentum. Thus it tends to settle into configurations that reduce the ratio of energy to angular momentum, like disks. Note that collisions alone don't suffice for this; energy loss is needed. Within a disk, particles have largely coherent velocities with only a small spread. For example, material within our section of the disk orbits at roughly 220 km/s, but its velocity dispersion is only in the tens of km/s. (The velocity dispersion is the root-mean-squared deviation from the average velocity.)

In contrast, dark matter has no coherent motion, instead moving in random directions with a wide spread of speeds.

ygfptx,https://www.reddit.com/user/Aseyhe,17,"Good question! It's indirect. For example, we can measure the circular orbit velocities of stars. Dark matter must have the same circular orbit velocity (i.e. velocity of a dark matter particle that is on a circular orbit), because it's subject to the same gravity. That's not yet the velocity dispersion, but it's close.
Next, we have observational evidence (e.g. rotation curves, lensing) that dark matter halos extend much farther than galaxies. This suggests that unlike the ordinary matter, the dark matter cannot efficiently cool -- otherwise it would condense into the galaxies as well. In fact the dark matter halos around large galaxies are consistent with what we find in simulations of dark matter that only interacts gravitationally. This suggests that dark matter is effectively collisionless in this context.
Since dark matter halos form by nearly isotropic collapse and accretion -- dark matter comes in from all directions -- their net angular momentum is small. Thus they should have very little net rotational motion and almost all random motion. This is also what the same simulations tell us.
The specific number ""270 km/s"" was a quick approximationestimate I made by taking the isothermal sphere model, which is a good approximation for galactic halos over a pretty wide range of radii, and noting that its velocity dispersion is sqrt(3/2) its circular velocity. The local circular velocity is known to be 220 km/s, so that yields 270 km/s.

Black holes, with mass so massive that it renders the strongest gravity possible, enough to bend light and absorb it completely, which is why it's called a black hole in the first place.
Now, from common parlance it is well known that objects that absorb visible light appear black cause they reflect almost none of it. Now this is an earthly phenomenon easily and commonly observable since almost all of Earth and everything on it is tangibly 'matter' except light itself and colours. Now, pigments are matter, they are tangible but their colours are not which is why the same sunlight renders different colours depending on degree of absorption, reflection and refraction, all dependent on the wavelegth and frequency of the spectrum. Extrapolating this to the outer universe, it makes sense that a black hole is black due to maximum absorption of the entire spectrum with no tangible reflection or refraction.
This brings us to the question of mass and what it actually is. Considering the gravitational constant, gravity is a phenomenon only possible between 'matter having mass' and since it is presumed to be a universal constant at that, it should be applicable for explaining all mass-matter interactions. Which would then require us to invoke the De Broglie hypothesis and consider both the particle and wave nature of light, because only the particle nature of light can elicit a mass-matter interaction resulting in it being pulled by gravity. Thus, photons must possess some mass and hence constitute matter for this to work and hold true. Then there's another perplexing component of gravitational waves of notable magnitude, aplitude and wavelength, being produced only by massive bodies; further complicating things but also pointing out the duality of both particle and wave nature of almost all universal things.
So keeping in mind the gravitational constant and dual nature of matter due to its mass, we can arrive at the Quantum Planck theory where the duality of existential matter, emits energy packets of quanta. This gives us 'h', the Planck's constant; which when corroborated with relativity and expanded in terms of the energy conversion formula by considering the dual nature of matter and thus its mass and wavelength, gives us h=m.c.lambda where 'm' is mass, 'c' is speed and 'lambda' is the De Broglie wavelength. Thus, if Einstein's theory is correct and 'h' is actually universally constant, then applying it to dark matter would suggest that c and lambda are actually negative since m is supermassive which could be true, since in the presence of a supermass, keeping the gravitational constant would mean that the photon particle must have close to zero mass and must be actually decelerating into the negatives in the presence of dark matter which would also mean that the wavelength turns negative as well since the photon is essentially at a standstill or even negative speed state and has essentially become only a particle and is no longer a wave, which would maintain the Planck's constant as well.
So does that mean that dark matter truly exists and this phenomenon is actually what is the time travel of relativity? Does this prove what has always been claimed, that time is another dimension? Cause negative axes exist only in a plane of dimension, so going negative would mean that we are going in a direction of that plane which is opposite of the positive axis from the origin. But at the same time, general material experience suggests that gravity causes acceleration in matter, but 'constant' formulas would suggest that supermassive gravity decelerates any material mass, or perhaps it is actually acceleration in the opposite direction as I mentioned and thus appears like deceleration which is also on a negative axis, and since two negatives into each other make the result positive, this is exactly what is happening here to this kind of acceleration.
Thus it can be concluded that dark matter if it actually exists, is indeed stationary while making matter accelerate and revolve around it by the sheer immense gravity of its mass, given that our physical theories and subsequently the formulas are accurate to the limits of absolutely no faults. Otherwise, all that has been taught in and about physics and other scientific phenomenon no longer holds any ground in terms of formulary and theoretical accuracy for universal phenomenon.

“Dark matter”, otherwise known as the P! particle, is the smallest particle possible while remaining on this “scale” (the universe, more or less). 
All particles are “complex”, meaning they are “built” from smaller particles. Complexity in the instance of particles means, basically, “size” - a “less complex” particle means it’s “smaller”. Considering that a particle can be a planet or a star or a nebula or an atom or a quark (etc) - a star is a more complex particle than a grain of beach sand.
Back to the P! particle. 
“Scale”, in this instance, means the “size” of space (space is a combination of particles and waveforms - that’s it - that’s what space is made of). “Our” scale (humans) is the universe - this is the tiny sliver of the cosmos “we” can perceive regardless how enhanced our senses (microscopes, electron microscopes, space bound telescopes, radio telescopes, etc.). Within our scale are forces (waveforms) that ’cause everything to stick together and work properly’. There are forces holding atoms together, holding molecules together, holding planets together, holding solar systems together, etc. These forces work on/with particles… I repeat, there are TWO things making up the entirety of space - particles and waveforms. But I digress.
The P! particle is the smallest possible particle in this “scale” - if it were less complex it would be downscale and no longer have significant effect on “our” universe. The P! particle, as are all particles, are created at the intersections of specific waveforms - specific waveform intersection(s) create specific particles - the most common being the P! particle (dark matter). The P! particle is what “space” is made of - those tiny particles, much smaller than sub-sub-sub atomic particles, define space. Particles have as one of their properties “volume” - meaning they exist as three dimensional ‘objects’ in space. Every point in space, point as defined mathematically until it’s populated by a particle, has a particle of AT LEAST P! complexity on it.

​
Our body heat is regulated by our body's ability to balance of how much heat we generate and how much heat we lose to the environment.  
Here are some examples of  heat production (notice how many are simply the result of normal metabolims):
-Basal metabolism
-Muscle activity, by shivering and muscle contractions
-Extra metabolism caused by the effect of sympathetic stimulation and norepinephrine, -epinephrine on the cells
-Extra metabolism caused by increased chemical activity in the cells, especially when the cell -temperature increases
-Extra metabolism caused by thyroid hormone and, to a lesser extent, testosterone and -growth hormone on the cells
-Extra metabolism needed for digestion, absorption, and storage of food
-Most of the heat produced in the body is generated in the liver, brain, heart, and skeletal -0--muscles during exercise.
And we balance that by also regulating mechanisms of heat Loss which is determined almost entirely by:
-How rapidly heat transfers from the skin to the surroundings
-How rapidly heat is conducted from where it is produced in the body core to the skin
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499843/
A fever triggers an adjustment of where that balance is, so as metabolic processes are triggered to run hotter, our circulatory system is triggered to allow less heat loss through our skin, and we don't sweat. 
The term ""a fever broke"" is referring to a person who after a fever has begun to sweat to allow for the rapid loss of all that heat.

yi3t9o,https://www.reddit.com/user/InfernalOrgasm,102,"The 3 phases of fever
Fever is your body’s way of letting you know something is wrong. In a way, the fever is helping to fight off your infection.
This happens in 3 phases.
Your body reacts and heats up
Your blood and lymphatic system make white blood cells, which fight infection. When you have an infection, you make lots of these cells. They work faster to try and fight off the infection.
The increase in these white blood cells affects your hypothalamus. This makes your body heat up, causing a fever.
In the early stages of a fever, you often feel cold and start to shiver. This is your body’s response to a rising temperature. The blood vessels in your skin tighten up (constrict), forcing blood from the outer layer of your skin to inside your body where it is easier to keep the heat in.
The outer skin layer then becomes cool and your muscles start to contract. This makes you shiver. Shivering produces more heat and raises your temperature even more.
The fever levels off
In the second phase of a fever, the amount of heat you make and lose is the same. So the shivering stops and your body remains at its new high temperature.
Cooling down
Your body starts to try and cool down so that your temperature can return to normal. The blood vessels in the skin open again, so blood moves back to these areas. You sweat which helps to cool the skin, this helps to cool down the body.
This phase of a fever may or may not happen naturally. You may need to have some medication to start it off, as well as treating the underlying cause of the fever.

Fevers are functional in that the higher body temperature begins to denature the proteins in infectious agents, or otherwise makes it inhospitable for them to reproduce, which allows the immune system to finish mopping up. We should let fevers do their thing unless the person is suffering a lot of discomfort (with the understanding that being sick in itself is going to be uncomfortable, and the fever will make them achy and weak. Which is a good signal to rest and let the immune system work.)
If the fever starts getting really out of control (like 105F/40C or higher) it runs the risk of cooking our own proteins as well, causing brain damage, or causing cells that we should probably hold onto to go into apoptosis. That's when we should step in and be like ""dude, back the hell off"" and try to lower body temperature or encourage the fever to break before it busts something it wasn't supposed to.

I have MS, and that means:
* One of my particular brain lesions is in my hypothalamus, which affects my body temperature and my perception of it. 
* My body temp going over about 37.5°C/99.5°F starts to make my other, previous symptoms come back/be worse, including dizziness, balance, and leg weakness. When I had a fever with COVID, I was literally clutching walls, back of chair, etc. to get from room to room. (Normally I don't have any walking issues, only when I'm too hot.)
* I almost never sweat. It will occasionally kick in, with maybe 20% of the sweat I should/used to be able to produce. So I can't bring my body temp down without external help like water/ice or cold air. If I don't have access to these, I'm at risk for heat stroke.
Thankfully, I don't get fevers often, but when I do, they seriously kick my butt. My first dose of COVID vaccine took me 3 days to feel mostly normal and a full week to feel completely normal. I have had 4 doses now, and know to proactively take both naproxen and acetaminophen at their recommended highest dose/interval.

It doesn't cost anything near what we pay to run a body of our size.  We know this because everything with ""cold blood"" does so for literally 10% of the cost (normalized for body weight and temperature).
Where do the other 90% of our baseline calories go?  Heat.  Specifically, we poke holes in the membranes of our mitochondria (via uncoupling proteins) to make them less efficient.  This means we burn more energy to get the same ATP (cellular energy molecule), the rest of which is heat.  This, in turn, heats our body and lets us be ""warm blooded"", at tremendous metabolic cost.  To get warmer, we simply increase the number of these proteins.  There's also diet drugs that do this, but they're incredibly dangerous because you can't plug the holes once they're made, you just have to wait for the proteins to break down.

I always wondered if that were a thing. It always seemed to me like an excellent way to burn calories. I grew up and currently live in Vermont where the winters get very very cold and it's well-known that you have to nearly double your caloric intake if you're going to be outdoors in cold temperatures for extended periods of time. Especially doing a vigorous activity like skiing or snowboarding on a blustery day, it's frankly INCREDIBLE the sheer amount of energy the human body can cough up when it's well-fed and the need arises. I tracked myself as burning like 7k calories in a single day once.
Likewise, just going on a short walk can sap an incredible amount of energy from your body if you're not dressed well in poor weather, and it can take several hours and several good meals to get your energy level back up so it's easy to imagine that a significant amount of your body's energy budget goes to keeping you warm.

From: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562334/
Milton and Wendlandt demonstrated that fever is mediated by the pyrogenic activity of prostaglandins (PGs), specifically PGE2. The synthesis of PGE2 begins with membrane phospholipids being converted to arachidonic acid (AA) by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). AA is then converted to PGH2 via cyclooxygenase (COX), after which PGH2 undergoes isomerization to PGE2 by PGE synthase. PGE2 acts via the EP3 receptor to affect specific neurons within the hypothalamus that aid in thermoregulation. Medications that inhibit COX are a mainstay of treatment for fevers, as it halts the conversion of AA into PGE2 and, thus, other prostanoids that can lead to fever.
The action of PGE2 begins when exogenous pyrogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses) stimulate endogenous pyrogens such as IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferon (IFN) to alter the hypothalamic set point via the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and raise the core body temperature. Endogenous pyrogens also act to trigger an immune and inflammatory response. The immune response includes leukocytosis, T cell activation, B cell proliferation, NK cell killing, and increased white blood cell adhesion. The inflammatory response includes increased acute phase reactants, increased muscle protein breakdown, and increased synthesis of collagen.[4]

White blood cells
The core cause of the fever starts with white-blood cells (specifically mononuclear phagocytes) that produce endogenous pyrogenic cytokines when they encounter a foreign agent (e.g. bacteria, virus, etc...) that is/produces pyrogen(s) TL;DR: Immune cells release a signal
Through unknown mechanisms they communicate to the brain which increases production of additional factors (likely prostaglandin E2) that then act on thermoregulatory neurons.  TL;DR The signal communicates with the brain telling it to allow an increase in temperature (think of it as the brain telling the rest of the body the normal temperature is now 100 degrees).
The major changes are thought to be derived from:

- Neurons expressing PGE2 receptor 3 (EP3) trigger the sympathetic nervous system to trigger norepinephrine release (works with adrenaline as part of your fight or flight response), which elevates body temperature by increasing thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue as well as by inducing vasoconstriction to prevent passive heat loss.
- Acetylcholine contributes to fever by stimulating muscle myocytes to induce shivering.

Metric thinking is decimal-based, while this older way is fraction-based. We still think of hours and years with fraction-based thinking, so the highly divisible relationships between the units is beneficial. But we don't realize that keep these ideas separate until we wonder why we never use kilominutes. To me it seems that there's a difference between linear and cyclical subjects, but that's possibly an illusion caused by the fraction-based thinking.
We shouldn't really call that older system 'Imperial', because time and angle measurement are much older. 'Fractional' or even 'Cyclical' might be better.

The main reason why metric time never caught on (despite the French making a good shot at it) was because it was also part of the liberalisation and industrialisation of society. Essentially, due to new ways of subdividing the day and month, people were forced to work longer and have less time off in order to make it fit nicely with metric time. Back then people usually only had one day off per week, so having a day off every ten days was much worse than a day off every 7 days. As for metric time of day, I don't know enough about it to tell why that didn't work out.
Also, the whole thing about fractions would make sense if Imperial was based around highly divisible numbers only... but it isn't. There are also units that are subdivided into twentieths, fourteenths, eighths and thirds, which are barely better or downright worse than tenths when it comes to dividing.

Well, ""we"" didn't, the Babylonians did. We only use legacy sexagesimal number systems b/c of backwards compatability, and b/c it's what we were taught.
If you wanted a more logical (and easy to work with) counting system, I'd probably nominate just using binary floating point numbers with implicit radians (ie. one full circle is either 1.0 or 2.0 units, depending on how you decided to define the base radian / revolution itself), for example.
Worth noting that the Babylonians (and ancient mathematicians, in general), only didn't do that b/c they didn't have the concept of floating point numbers (or zero), and ended up with base 12 / 60 / 360 for a whole bunch of other historical / anthropological reasons – sort of like how we use base 10 despite that generally being worse (not trivially divisible) than base 2 or base 16, for instance.
So while you could probably rework all of SI to use floating point binary units (and rework / remove constants to actually make the units involved directly based on fundamental constants of the universe, while you're at it (ie. remove all of the messy physics ""constants"" that you have to substitute in everywhere)), no one is (unfortunately) going to do that, b/c it would break everything, and would, generally, be totally incompatible with what most people are used to working with.

But it's not close to the number of days in the year, it's the actual number of days in the year in an administrative calendar in Mesopotamia.  This was connected to the idea that the ecliptic is divided into 12 parts by stars, which we still have today in the form of the zodiac, and so the ecliptic was also divided into 360 degrees which were used to note down the position of planets and other astronomical (/astrological) phenomenon.  Then, later on, the Greeks decided to borrow this notation of 360 degrees for geometry when trying to apply Greek geometry to Babylonian astronomy, and that's where we get it from.  
Basically, we can trace the idea from early Babylonian calendars to astronomical notation to Greek angle notations.  But in contrast there's no similar sign of Babylonians messing around with compositing circles from geometric shapes.   Most critically, the 360 degree arrangement was used for the ecliptic specifically long before being applied to circles in general.

Yup you made a mistake.
2xy/(xy - 2x - 2y) = z 
where x and y is number of sides of respective polygon, assuming that you only take maximum 2 different type of polygon. If you take only one polygon then x = y.
Z is total number of polygon require to make circle therefore has to be integers and sign will indicate inner or outer circle.
You get 360 because 360 can be divided 1 - 10 except for 7. For 7 it is 42 side polygon and triangle needed that's why you missed it.

I've had to re-explain a few times now, so here's another version:
The basic construction is, concatenate regular polygons in regular end-to-end tiling in such a way that the concatenated edges of those polygons can be inscribed on a circle. I gave two examples in the linked image in the original post.
I didn't say in the post, but it's an easy problem to solve numerically - thereI can show that are a total of 17 (misread a graph, had typed '19' here) ways to do this, no more. For example a sequence of 15 triangle-pentagon pairs (like in the figure); or 5 triangle-pentadecagon pairs; or just 2 pentagon-20gon pairs.
It just can't be done with sets of 3 or more polygons (you can imagine why).

ylawmv,https://www.reddit.com/user/SwollenPear,6,"I think what's going on is when you switch between a triangle and a polygon, the difference in reference angles between the shapes is the curvature per shape added.
For example, a reference angle in a triangle is 60 deg (assuming it's equilateral) where as square is 90 deg. The difference is 30 deg. So every shape you connect you are changing the angle by 30 deg which would give you 12 shapes in a cycle.
Another example of this is using a triangle and a pentagon like in your image. The difference between a reference angle in a triangle (60 deg) and pentagon (72 deg) is 12 deg. Dividing 360 deg by 12 deg gives you 30 shapes in a cycle.
I think as long as the difference in reference angles divides 360 deg evenly, it will complete a cycle.
EDIT:
In addition, if you are using the same shape, there is not difference is reference angles. It's just the reference angle of the one shape. If you are just using triangles, the ref angle is 60 deg. So just divide 360 deg by 60 deg to get 6 segments in a cycle.
Using just hexagons would give you a ref angle of 120 deg. So only 3 segments required to complete a cycle.

Here’s what I realized: The least common multiple of those numbers (thenumber of segments to the perimeter of the triangle-polygon circle) is 360! (at least, I’m pretty sure of it.. maybe here I have made a mistake).

Yes, because 360 is sort of close to a grab bag of small prime (and non-prime) numbers that you might run into when when doing primitive arithmetic, or shape tiling.
It's a nice base number when either a) you already use a sexagesimal number system, b) you don't have the concept of floating point numbers (or zero) to work with – and/or find working with that (and fractions) to be sufficiently difficult that you'd prefer to just work with big whole numbers instead.
And while 360 is better for whole number division than base 10 (eg. 1000, or w/e), that's b/c base 10 is a terrible number system. ie. is neither trivially divisible (unlike base 2), nor is a composite of many small prime numbers (like base 60 / 360 / 3600, or the US customary units system. which has fun things like the definition of the mile, ie. 2 * 3 * 11 * 2 * 5 * 2^3 – and while that is also easily divisible by many small numbers (sans 7), I wouldn't recommend using that (ie. 5280) as the basis for your numeric counting system either)
Still, pretty neat observation about circular shape tilings. The observation that those happen to tile in divisions of 360 is interesting, but unsurprising – those tiling sequences are also small numbers, and thus small prime composites (and as for why, you could probably dive into the geometry of the shapes involved), and thus fit neatly into a bigger prime composite that's basically just a superset of those. This does hold... unless you find a tiling that includes bigger primes like 7 or 11 (if such a thing even exists), for example.

yeah basically i just thought it was neat, but was curious if there was more to it.
you kind of sound like you know some things.. could there be, do you think, any connection to the fact that the internal angles of a polygon always sum to a multiple of 180 deg?
also, re tilings with bigger primes.. i wrote a quick script to find all the 'simple' tilings (of regular polgons plus triangles), searched up to 60-gons, and found only those i mentioned in the post... that's part of why i was so excited about it! but maybe you could keep finding more circles by combining bigger polygons (you can do it with squares and pentagons for example).

ylawmv,https://www.reddit.com/user/half3clipse,5,"the likely answer is astronomy, which is a field of study which predates even trig.
Recording time and dates was done by astronomical records. Lunar calender's are sufficient for a lot of things, but not good astronomical records, which gave rise to fixed calendars. A common ancient fixed calendar has 360 days, and the babylonians were no exception in using one. 
When later greek astronomers applied the (relatively recent for the ancient world) advancements in geometry to astronomy it, presumably, made obvious sense to use existing measures when performing calculations. A circle corresponds to one year, a year has 360 days. Dividing the circle into 360 parts is both intuitive, and eliminates unit conversion from days to angles and back. 
Other measurements of angles will have existed:  Eratosthenes used units of 1/60th of a circle. However units of 1/360th of a circle remain one of the most frequent for astronomy. You also don't have calculators, so obtaining the value of trig functions and chord lengths and so on is a huge amount of work. So even if you wish to apply trigonometry to non astronomical uses, you still want to make use of existing trig tables as much as possible, which will have been calculated and recorded by astronomers, using units of 1/360th of a circle. 
If that unit was terribly inconvenient for measuring angle for non astronomical purposes, something else may have been used. (and we see that today: Radians are pretty much strictly better for a lot of modern uses). However in the ancient world one of he better ways to obtain small angles is to get an easily obtainable right angle, which can be found to great accuracy, and then follow geometric procedures to partition it, and then either partition those partitions. 90 degrees to a right angle can easily be divided into whole numbers parts and reasonable fractional parts, and works well when using hand tools to measure or find angles.

Am I just doing some kind of circular-reasoning numerology here or is this maybe a part of the long-lost rationale for the division of the circle into 360 degrees?
For those who don't understand the explanation above (i sympathize): to be clear, this method gets you exactly 360 subdivisions of a circle but it has nothing to do with choice of units. It's a coincidence, not a tautology, as some people are suggesting.. I thought it was an interesting coincidence because the method relies on constructing circles (or cycles) out of elementary geometrical objects (regular polyhedra).

Your choice of ""elementary"" geometrical objects is equivalent to a choice of units. If you were interested in 77-gons and 89-gons you probably would not end up with a nice LCM. The counter-question is: why do you feel like a choice of particular forms of tiling based on small-integer n-gons is ""morally"" different than a particular choice of small prime numbers?
Those choices are somewhat arbitrary, but on the other hand, there's some argument to be made that physical reality constrains us in ways such that small-integer subdivisions/n-gons are convenient.

edit
and i don't think you could get 'circles' with sets of 3 different n-gons, since you'd have a wavy change in the bend from step-to-step. so we just want cycles that lay segments down on a circle, which i'm pretty sure restricts the problem to pairs, at most, of n-gons.

ylawmv,https://www.reddit.com/user/Mac223,1,"Here's what I think is going on, starting with the pentagon as an example. At each vertex of the pentagon which lies along the circle there is a kink with an angle 180 - (540/5 + 60) = 12°, and since we have two vertices per pentagon on the circle we get 24° per pentagon. 360 is divisible by 24 into 15, so 15 segments make a circle.
For an n-gon the angle of a vertex is 180(n-2)/n, so the expression for the angle per n-gon becomes 2(180 - (180(n-2)/n + 60)) which simplifies to 360(6-n)/(3n). Here we see why we bother with algebra in the first place - after simplifying the expression we see there's a factor of 360 which cancels out when we do the division to find the number of segments 360/(360(6-n)/(3n)) = 3n/(6-n).
So your construction works for any n such that 3n/(6-n) is a whole number of segments.

What I want to know is whether or not this has been noted before, or proposed as a possible method for how the B's came up with 360

I've never heard of it, but that's not saying much. N-gons, circles, and equilateral triangles are quite popular. Unfortunately 3*7/-1 is a whole number so we can construct a circle with 21 segments, and 7 doesn't share any factors with 360. It seems unlikely in the extreme that someone would get this right for all the other n-gons but miss this one, especially considering how comparatively simple the other explanations are.
It's a interesting puzzle though! I might use this one day in class.

When the eggs are laid by the mother they’re very warm, and as they cool the material inside the egg shrinks a little bit. The two membranes pull apart a little and create a small pocket or sack of air. As the developing bird grows, it breathes in oxygen from the air sack and exhales carbon dioxide. Several thousand microscopic pores all over the surface of the egg allow the CO2 to escape and fresh air to get in.

AsIt compares to zebras running close-packed, each improvesimproving its individual chances because the lion will catch only one.
Edit: Thinking further,  I  concede that there could  be a big overlap between social behavior and selfish gene survival. For example, the first to hatch could be helping out its siblings by offering itself up to a predator.

In another it was said that after a positive pregnancy test and a negative ultrasound test the next step was to look for an ectopic pregnancy (which took the team a while to figure out).

The only malaria episode I remember is where the guy can’t speak properly, a journalist with bipolar or something. They diagnose malaria at the end but I don’t remember them mentioning fungus. 
I checked for that episode and it was s2e10 “failure to communicate”, diagnosis was cerebral malaria. Some websites listed the goofs and they say that when they looked into the slides the “parasite” that was supposed to be malaria looked more like the bacteria that causes syphilis.
I’m trying to find the episode with toxoplasmosis but I can’t remember what the episode was called. I remember it was about a politician. I’ll edit it when I find it.

House is about as far from real medicine as you can get. The number of times his medical license would have been revoked is very high. He uses questionable methods and skips over very basic diagnostics on a predictably regular scale. The show puts that in the light of him being outspoken and clever, but in real life that would just be bullheaded stupidity.
Don't expect there will always be a ""real"" explanation for what he's doing, because there often isn't. Some comments here have brought up subdermal birth control for the scene in question, and maybe that was the intent...

Basically, humans (and I would assume almost all animals) have an internal circadian clock that regulates bodily functions. For some odd reason, ours tends to run around 25 hours per day (not 24).

y7s95g,https://www.reddit.com/user/redmonkees,132,"Our Human circadian system (and most vertebrates and many inverts, though often through different biological mechanisms) is completely governed by light availability. Light presence degrades a protein that is a part of our circadian “clock”, and sets a rhythm that tells us to sleep. You can set a circadian rhythm in humans with just an hour of light exposure at the beginning and end of the day time. Interestingly, hibernation and different types of torpor (prolonged moments of rest) are totally unlinked to the circadian system, which solely governs our sleep based on the position of sun in the sky/daylight. When you think about it, that makes sense - they often go into burrows, where sunlight reaches very little. Hibernation is actually more so linked to cold; though whether that’s a direct link to cold or a result of decreased nutrient availability varies between species. It been shown that some species at the very least actually are able to complete shut down their circadian system from functioning during hibernation to prevent interference with the two systems. 
A really interesting part of animal life in the arctic circle though is that not all species hibernate. Arctic reindeer, which don’t hibernate, have been observed to have a much less controlling circadian system compared to closely related, non arctic species. They’ve essentially shut off their circadian system as an adaptation to maintain essential biological needs throughout the day. They are able to graze periodically every few hours throughout the day as their body needs, even without the presence of sunlight. They do still have higher prevalence of melatonin during the night, which indicates that they can still denote when the seasons change, but it’s not linked to a distinct sleep period, unlike other ruminates. Unfortunately, that is an adaptation to the environment that would take generations and generations to arise in a species randomly, and as humans are relatively new to the arctic environment in an evolutionary sense, that adaptation has not been observed yet in native human populations of the arctic. Humans are still beholden to the circadian system in the arctic, meaning that in periods of full dark there is more pressure to sleep in a free running period of 25 hours. 
Also, because is was mentioned, the 25 hour free running period you spoke of (free running means the natural period of sleep observed in no-light conditions) is something that has been observed in many species. It’s not actually odd like you said, because when you arrive at the mechanic behind it the answer makes sense. The link is that it’s only present in diurnal (active during the day) species. Nocturnal species tend to have a 23 hour free running period. Because the protein that signals sleep degrades in light, and that degradation takes time, this allows diurnal and nocturnal animals to be awake at the right time when entrained to the sunlight, sometime around daybreak and sometime after sunset respectively. Theoretically in some exoplanet that might have a 20 hour day, species that evolved there with the same circadian rhythms would have a 21 and 19 hour free running period because of that.

I thought it made a lot of sense and I wish it was a thing in the southern US.

y7s95g,https://www.reddit.com/user/PeaEyeEnnKay,267,"I have a sleep disorder so I've spent a fair amount of time reading up on various aspects of sleep. It's a complex topic and we are learning new things all the time.
In basic form, we have various 'clocks' in our body at the cellular level and these create various phases of chemical expression, responses, and reactions. Some of these are essentially free running and will happily go out of sync with the day and some are driven by external inputs that act as a reset. These drive things such as feeling hungry or sleepy.
One of the primary 'daily' clock reset mechanisms is a protein generated by cells in our eyes in response to ambient light levels (we don't just have green, red, and blue receptors in our eyes). And this is largely, but not solely, responsible for our body taking a clock which naturally free runs over or under 24 hours and syncs it with the 24-hour cycle.
We don't really have a natural sleep cycle because fairly recent societal norms have pushed us to an idea that we should sleep for an 'ideal' 8 hours and we have technology that means we live in an artificially generated environment (on demand lighting, stimulants, depressants, for example) that accommodate this.
If we look back in history even just a couple of hundred years we see quite different patterns such as people sleeping for 4 hours, waking up and doing some task, and then going back to sleep for a few hours.
To actually answer your sub questions, it's likely impossible to say how we would have evolved on a planet with a different daily cycle and it could be any variation of sleep periods and awake periods. There are a large variety of sleep patterns even within our own species let alone when we look out toward other animals, where we get in to such situations as hibernation, partial sleep where only half the brain 'shuts down', nocturnal/diurnal variations over the course of a year, and animals that sleep multiple times per day/night.
And that's all assuming we're in a solar system that has only one sun and not in, say, a binary system that means every single day/night is different, from a human timeline perspective, as the multiple suns move through different phases that could cycle over the course of hundreds/thousands of years.

y7s95g,https://www.reddit.com/user/PeaEyeEnnKay,23,"The 4 and 4 is much closer to what a lot of people's normal pattern is historically. That largely changed with the introduction of electric lighting and industrialisation resulting in 9-5 type jobs becoming a norm and societal pressure to get a ""healthy night's sleep"" at a time that fits in with this enforced schedule. This is tied in to a bunch of stupid holier than thou sayings such as ""the early bird catches the worm"". Weird that in order to do this most people need alarm clocks because if left to their own devices they would not be able to meet this schedule.
12-8 isn't actually what most people have, but it is one of those oft quoted stats.
There are many variants. If you look up chronotypes and find a graph of them you'll see the bell curve we fit in to. Chronotypes are used by sleep researchers because of the variance that exists even for people who go to sleep around the same time of day. A chronotype is based around the mid point of sleep. So someone who sleeps 11-7 would have the same chronotype as someone who sleeps 12-5. One sleeps for 8 hours, the other for 5, these are both perfectly normal. 
Our chronotype usually changes with age. One of the earliest studies I know of this was with regard to changes in teenagers. Teenagers don't get up late because they stayed up late they stay up late because their chronotype shifted due to puberty and this in turns makes it difficult for them to get up at a 'normal' time. They can then end up sleep deprived by society forcing a sleep schedule on them.
Typically as someone moves in to their 20s their chronotype shifts back again. As you reach middle age your chronotype shifts again, and again when you reach old age (hence the prevalence of old people that stay up late and get up early). Society doesn't tend to accommodate these shifts and we end up with people having sleep problems as they move out of phase with what is considered normal.
I don't really know anything about the ADHD side of things, I have recently found out I may be autistic (this is apparently no surprise to some of my friends) but I don't have any kind of diagnosis.
I do appear to have a sleep disorder known as Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. My personal natural sleep appears to be 5am to 11am and it would seem, from talking to my mother, the way I've been from birth.
Unfortunately I do not appear to be able to get a diagnosis for this as it's not commonly recognised here (UK) yet as a thing, even amongst sleep specialists. It was only officially added to the NIH in the US a few years ago. 
Research on CRY1 gene mutations (what I believe I may have) and their effect on circadian rhythms is pretty new but there are potential links to autoimmune problems (which I have) and autism/ADHD. But not enough research yet to be conclusive in my mind.

As a kid my parents forced me to get up at 5:30 every day to practice piano before school, and just assumed I was getting enough sleep because I went to bed at 9:30/10.

As I read it it explained so much of what I felt on a daily basis. One of those things is as you described getting an amount of sleep which should be adequate but leaves you a zombie all day. You're basically jet lagged.
If you read posts from people who travel around the world and then whinge about their jet lag you'll see a lot of commonality. Now all I can think is ""Well folks that was what near every day of the first 40 years of my life was like"".
There are a bunch of other things I used to suffer that I can now best describe as being asleep while conscious, your brain being in a REM like state while you are awake. Leading to mild hallucinations (waking dreams basically) and having no recollection of how I got from one place to another (sleep walking while conscious).
I've now rejected all societal pressures (I sleep when I want) for the sake of my health and I finally know what it is like to be 'normal'.

Regarding hunting, I believe you're not far from the mark.

Historical evidence suggests that “until the close of the early modern era, Western Europeans experienced two major intervals of sleep bridged by up to an hour or more of quiet wakefulness” [33 ] (see also [30 ]). Our results suggest that the bimodal sleep pattern that may have existed in Western Europe is not present in traditional equatorial groups today and, by extension, was probably not present before humans migrated into Western Europe. Rather, this pattern may have been a consequence of longer winter nights in higher latitudes. In this view, the “recent” disappearance of bimodal sleep was not a pathological development caused by restricted sleep duration, but rather a return to a pattern still seen today in the groups we studied, enabled by the electric lights and temperature control that restored aspects of natural conditions in the tropical latitudes.

Biphasic sleep was not unique to England, either – it was widely practised throughout the preindustrial world. In France, the initial sleep was the ""premier somme""; in Italy, it was ""primo sonno"". In fact, Eckirch found evidence of the habit in locations as distant as Africa, South and Southeast Asia, Australia, South America and the Middle East.

So it’s unclear, at least, but the bbc article also suggests compelling evidence that biphasic sleep exists even today in Africa, and other places without artificial light

The participants, who were mostly farmers, were asked to wear an ""actimeter"" – a sophisticated activity-sensing device that can be used to track sleep cycles – for 10 days, to track their sleep patterns.
""What we found was that [in those without artificial light], there was a period of activity right after midnight until about 01:00-01:30 in the morning,"" says Samson, ""and then it would drop back to sleep and to inactivity until they woke up at 06:00, usually coinciding with the rising of the Sun.""

y7s95g,https://www.reddit.com/user/redmonkees,19,"Kind of sort of. It was a misleading study and didn’t fully understand the mechanisms behind sleep. They were devoid of sunlight, but not light altogether. They still used artificial light, which disrupted the degradation of proteins in the circadian clock which normally would signal you to sleep during periods of darkness. They essentially deprived their bodies of sleep by extending the period where the signal to stay up (light) was present. While a 48 hour period can be entrained, biological assays have shown that there is still a biologically maintained free running period of around 25 hours throughout the body. This is present in almost all diurnal organisms (organisms that are active during the day). Nocturnal organisms tend to have a free running period closer to 23 hours. Both of these have been observed in environments completely devoid of all light, and also in blind humans with complete enucleation (lack of eyeballs), who are unable to have any photo reception. The 48 hour period works because it is a natural multiple of 24, and allows some synchronicity with biological functions throughout the body that were determined by the 25 hour free running circadian clock. While we can function under those conditions, and will entrain to that period, by no means is our biological determined sleep cycle specifically 48 hours.

y7s95g,https://www.reddit.com/user/redmonkees,7,"So, what you’re talking about specifically is the principle of entrainment. Organisms that use light to determine the length of sleep have a chemically based circadian clock where a protein degrades with light exposure and causes the “clock” to send out a wake signal, and vice versa for dark. These organisms can entrain to any length of day, given a certain period of light/dark cycle. You can shorten the sleep cycle by exposing organisms to a shorter day/night cycle, and lengthen it via a longer day/night cycle. Humans can adapt to a 48 hour day, in fact we have done so artificially as some have already mentioned, but I think it should be made clear that the human biological clock as it stands does not change as a result of that, it still naturally has an approximately 24 hour period (23-25 hours depending on sleep behavior across species). 48 hours actually works pretty well for us because biotic functions that work in a 24 hour clock can still synchronize fairly well with that multiple of 24. Getting away from that multiple can push some biological functions with 24 hour periods out of synch with the natural rhythm, but we will still have sleep cycles that match the light cycle because of entrainment. 
Now, if we had originated and or evolved on a planet with a 48 hour day, that would be a different story, though I think that’s obvious enough. Theoretically if humans from earth lived on this planet for generations we would eventually evolve a natural clock that aligned with the 48 hour period of the sun.

y7s95g,https://www.reddit.com/user/redmonkees,3,"In the eye there are photo receptors that respond to light, I think that much is obvious, but more specifically there are specific types of photoreceptive cells called retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) which contain melanopsin, a pigment that is energized by a certain wavelength of light. That energizing causes the the RGC to send a neural pulse, called an action potential to a region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located near the hypothalamus. Now, interestingly while RGCs do play a role in sight, this specific pathway to the SCN is different than the pathway to the optical cortex(which is at the back of the head, not near the hypothalamus), and is why some blind people can still respond to light and maintain a circadian rhythm without being able to actually see or process what they are seeing. 
Now, this is complex and it’s been a minute since I studied the specific pathway, so I’ll explain it incredibly simply. Once the action potential reaches the SCN, it innervates cells there, which is where the proteins I mentioned are created. Those proteins act as transcription factors, which cause the transcription of many genes essential for sleep, such as melatonin. And I think that’s where I’ll leave it, as I’ll get it too convoluted, and I’ve probably already said some things wrong. Just know that’s generally how the system functions, and that it’s the SCN that acts as the hub which releases hormonal signals to synchronize the entire body’s cells individual clocks. 
If you’re interested in the subject, there are much more in depth articles and videos on the circadian clock I’d recommend looking into.

But if I had to give an answer to your specific question I would guess if the new planets rotation was close enough, we would adapt to it but 48 hours would be too long.

If we had evolved on another planet, those same forces would have shaped us into a species adapted for that specific planet. This would include our required number of hours of sleep. 
As others have noted, our artificial environment has also shaped our sleep schedules, so that we typically sleep for 8 hours straight. In the past, those 8 hours would be split up (with a waking period in the middle of the night, a nap in the middle of the day, etc). 
So if humans traveled to another planet and lived there, we would still require 8 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period, broken up however the artificial environment allowed. If we evolved on another planet, we would require a different number of hours of sleep. 
Of course, some individuals need more or less than 8 hours, and this has been scientifically verified.

y7s95g,https://www.reddit.com/user/secondhand_goulash,1,"As others have pointed out, we have an intrinsic circadian cycle that runs just slightly longer than 24 hours. Other organisms, such as mice, can have slightly shorter cycles at around 23.5 hrs. Hence the term circadian: from Latin circa, meaning ""about"" and dies, meaning ""day"". 
This circadian rhythm is built-in and governs multiple functions, of which sleep is one. Temperature and cortisol secretion, for example, also oscillate with a similar daily period. We know this from some crazy time-isolation experiments where subjects lived in caves or isolated rooms with no indicators of time. Because our natural cycle is longer than 24 hours, these subjects slept a little bit later everyday and after some time they ended up drifting their sleep onset so that it occured during our daytime (they had no idea whether it's day or night). Later, it was discovered that exposure to light can reset this cycle so that it prevents this natural daily advance in sleep onset. This is why we follow a 24 hour cycle in the outside world where sunlight resets this cycle so that it begins at a new phase ever day.
Importantly, the maximum amount of time that this cycle can be reset is 3 hours per day. This is why it takes a few days for jet lag to really clear up.
On other planets, we would still follow our 25 hr circadian cycle but we'd reset it everyday depending on availability of light. If the day on that other planet was something be like 36 hours, my guess is that we'd be constantly jetlagged if we planned our activities around our circadian cycle.
On a related note, these time-isolation experiments found that the subjects began to do something weird after about a month where they would stay up way past their bedtime and then sleep for 15 hours without even realizing it. They then bounced back to a normal 25 hour cycle before getting desynchronized again and starting a crazy cycle 40 to 50 hours long. The researchers figured out  that this was linked to body temperature at time of sleep onset. Basically, long sleeps always began at high body temperature and normal sleeps at low body temperature.

In experiments on rats, who are very similar to us as mammals, removal of external light stimuli, or the constant presence of light stimuli, resulted in an unchecked 24.5 hour circadian rhythm and the hours of the actual true day that they were sleeping/awake gradually cycled through different times, by about a half hour each day.

Blood thinners do not ""thin"" the blood in the way that one would think of it (e.g. they do not cause hemodilution and are not colloid/crystaloid volume expanders like NS, Hartmans solution, or Ringger's lactate, certain lipid emulsions, etc.), but rather posess antiplatelet properties-  e.g. they prevent platelets from sticking together usually by inhibiting a clotting factor. The ditary restriction flow from the fact that certain vitamins are chemical precursors to clotting factors- particularly vitamin A and Vitamin K. In fact these vitamins are used to reverse the effects of some blood thinners, such as sodium warfin in cases of poisoning. 
Betablockers act on CNS beta receptors and supress the effects of adreniline/epinephrine causing vassodialation and decreased heart rate.  However, they have no effect on the production of HCl in the stomach. Most substances cannot be absorbed through the stomach, Ethanol is the rare exception, such that these drugs have no effect on digestion at the level of the stomach.
However, some beta blockers (metoprolol and propranolol were studied) do speed up GI motility (increased parastalsis) in dose-dependent fashion at the level of the esophogus sigmoid colon, but the effects were marginal at therapeutic serum concentrations, and other beta blockers were shown to have opposite effect.

yttnde,https://www.reddit.com/user/gray_patch_czar,4,"Insults of low blood flow to the gut can ultimately lead to digestion issues, but not commonly from medication use like you are asking about. Certain medications affect the digestive system by limiting blood flow as a side effect, although not typical blood thinners like heparin or warfarin or riveroxiban. NSAIDs such as aspirin and ibuprofen (which do have mild ""blood thinning"" effect-although unrelated) do constrict gastric blood flow and lead to increased risk of gastric ulcers and are recommended to be taken with food.
 If blood pressure does get too low (usually in the case of shock), certain areas of the large intestine can die and bleed from lack of blood flow causing digestive issues. In addition, sometimes people with really bad vascular disease like atherosclerosis or high cholesterol can get stomach pain after they eat because the digestive system is demanding more blood flow than their arteries can give them.
As other commenters have already mentioned, ""blood thinners"" are anticoagulants, meaning they make it harder for your blood to clot. Beta blockers work by slowing down the heart and allowing veins to dilate. Neither of these mechanisms directly affect blood flow to your digestive system.

As all the other comments mentioned, beta blockers and other agents that decrease heart rate and blood pressure do not affect absorption from the GI tract. However, there are some agents with the opposite effect that do. 
Many agents we refer to as vasopressors can have this affect, some common ones would be norepinephrine, epinephrine, and phenylephrine. These agents act on act on alpha-1 receptors as well as others. Their action causes peripheral vasoconstriction, which increases and maintains blood pressure, often in critically ill patients. This action maintains adequate perfusion of the heart and brain, but can cause less blood flow to other areas due to vasoconstriction. This can include the GI tract, which may cause decreased absorption of medications and nutrients from the GI tract. 
This is a very simplified explanation, but it’s the first thing to came to mind.

yttnde,https://www.reddit.com/user/Ehegi,2,"Hello. Gastroenterologist here. As with all health questions, the answer is nuanced and complicated. I’ll highlight a few relevant points here that I didn’t see addressed in some of the other responses.
1) The digestion process is multistep and the stomach involvement is one of the earlier steps. Most of the absorptive surface area is in the small intestines. The stomach provides mechanical mixing in an acidic environment in addition to the mechanical breakdown started by the chewing process in some of the digestive enzymes found in saliva. Other key enzymes, including those made by the exocrine pancreas are mixed with the food stuffs starting in the second portion of the duodenum via biliary system through bile excretion. 
2) the stomach is sensitive to vascular considerations similar to all tissues in the body. The minimal amount of blood delivery for oxygenation and energy delivery for a tissue to function will vary depending on the tissue. The cardiac output necessary for functions at rest are generally much lower than the maximum cardiac output that the heart can achieve. While cases of insufficient blood delivery to the G.I. tract can occur, this would be unusual to come from just the medications mentioned here at intended doses unless there were some other extenuating circumstance. Gut ischemia can occur with severe disruption of blood flow such as vascular blockage of specific systems (such as a clot) or global hypoperfusion from significant decreases in cardiac output, like that found in shock physiology.
Please excuse any typos as this response was done on my phone via voice recognition.

Wow, thisThis is a really good question and interesting to think about. Blood thinner is a very broad generalization. To increase diffusion digestion, just ""thinner"" blood is unlikely to make a difference, unless micro thrombotic events are happening that interfere, which might actually be the case in severe diabetics, smokers + other conditions, or those with metastatic cancer. But I don't think there'sd be any clinical relevancy here, nor has it been looked into; these parties are not suffering from relevant malabsorption otherwise, and if they were, you'd look into less dangerous avenues to increase it.
Interesting though, some ""blood thinners"" like pentoxyfylline actually increase the lumen of vessels, the malleability of blood cells and vessels, and even increase growth of new vessels. I haven't gone down a pub med deep dive, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that pentoxyfylline might aid here and even hold some therapeutic value. If it hasn't been looked into, someone should!

Beta blockers and CCBs (a blood pressure med) both decrease gastric emptying. Blood thinners increase the risk of GI bleeds, particularly in those where ulcer disease is already known. 
The plethora of drugs that have nausea and GI upset as their most common side effect also reflects how multifactorial a dysfunction of our gut can be. (Blood vessels, flora, sensitivities, rate of peristalsis/emptying etc.) 
However, when used correctly, these medications are attempting to optimise blood flow to our organs, and therefore decrease end-organ damage from high-pressurised, turbulent vasculature, including in the gut.
For example, uncontrolled hypertension causes increased incidence of gastric ulceration, bleeding, and gastroparesis from damage to the vasa nervorum. (Tiny blood supply to the nerves)

This being said, it mostly is just a difference of scale; we not only have way more cells in our bodies, but eukaryotic cells are many times larger than (most) bacteria (this obviously varies a lot, but generally it is the case), so they’re far more vulnerable to damage or death by chemical means unless they’re specifically adapted against it.

And that’s just actual bacteria, because there are also archaea (not actually bacteria, but historically conflated with them) that can survive in such extremely high temperatures that their specially heat-adapted enzymes are actually an indispensable tool in biotech (in particular, PCR makes use of a thermophilic archaeal DNA transcriptase so that it can speed things up with higher temperatures, iirc).

So with water bears it’s more that they’re really good at weathering extremes, but not necessarily actually living in them per se, whereas bacteria and archaea can often actually exhibit active cellular metabolism and other processes even in some really extremesextreme habitats.

When you’re distilling ethanol, there’s a point at about the 95% mark where the combination of hydrogen bonding between the OH groups in the water and ethanol as well as the vapour pressure of the solution make it so that the boiling ethanol will pull the water with it, making it basically impossible to distill 100% ethanol using regular non-chemical means. Because of the OH group wanting to interact with water, ethanol is super hygroscopic, meaning you are correct that if concentrated enough it will pull moisture from the air. 
Pure ethanol absolutely exists though, and it’s a really useful solvent in a lot of labs. However, because of the reasons stated above, it’s generally kept in a sealed glass bottle over what’s known as molecular sieves. They’re these little beads of metal-silicates that basically form a microscopic mesh that can trap and “sieve” the water from the ethanol since the ethanol molecule is too big to get through.

Our analysis also updates the widely-cited 10:1 ratio, showing that the number of bacteria in the body is actually of the same order as the number of human cells, and their total mass is about 0.2 kg.

Did you not actually read the abstract on the paper you posted?

Considering these are both from the same year, I’m assuming they’re maybe actually referencing the same study.
Once again, this isn’t actually relevant because OP clearly wants to know the effects of alcohol on individual bacteria versus human cells (which as I note, are not really going to be very different), as they state at the end of the post, not on the generalized effect of alcohol on the entire bacterial human microbiome.
But, if they did want to know the latter, everything I said still 100% holds anyway (if you were to take just the entire 0.2 kg mass of bacteria from an average human body and expose it to high concentrations of ethanol, it would still pretty definitely die???), and even as a pedantic nitpick your comment states something blatantly incorrect, and the study you posted to supposedly back it up actually contradicts your claim pretty clearly.

No there are a lot of different types of cells, bacteria ahashas much simpler cell walls so alcohol dissolves them easily. 
But our skin and mucous membranes have evolved specifically to resist the outside environment, through the use of condensed keratin at the surface, that forms a very touch layer, still if you put your hand in concentrated alcohol long enough it will damage your skin. mucous membranes are similar to skin except with less dry keratin on the outside.

Human cells do not even have cell walls, unlike bacteria.
If you're thinking of the cell membrane, then I wouldn't say the bacterial membrane is any simpler. The lipids used are slightly different, but that's not a question of simplicity or complexity. And for example Gram negative bacteria would have two membranes, which is more complex than the single membrane of human cells (though we have additional membranes around some organelles).
In any case, alcohol would damage our cells just as easily as bacterial cells. If they were exposed to the same concentration.

y96dfg,https://www.reddit.com/user/Jaedos,7,"Take a drink of some high proof alcohol.  That burn you're feeling is the start of a chemical burn.  The mucosa is pretty good at regenerating and also diffusing chemicals, but if you just gargled some Everclear, you'd legit burn your oral pharynx.
The difference between bacteria being killed and cells being destroyed is dependent on a few factors.  Bacteria, when free floating and not contained in a biofilm, provide alcohol a lot more surface area to act on.  Cells almost exclusively interact with alcohol as part of a tissue matrix, so at any point in time, the alcohol only interacts with a portion of the cell.
Ethanol(and other alcohols) , like soaps/detergents, is a strong polar molecule that has a large attraction force difference at various ends.  It has a strong positive and negative end like a strong magnet.
Cells and bacterium both have lipid bilayers of various sorts that are also highly polarized, which permits them to arrange themselves in membrane layers and ""shells"".  This is where alcohol and detergents come into play.
The alcohol molecule is has a polar attraction to the lipid structures of the membrane walls.  If that attraction is strong enough, it can pull the lipid molecule out of the formation, creating holes in the membrane.  This occurs with both tissue cells and bacteria.  The process is known as 'denaturing'; which roughly means ""to change a protein structure"".
Pull away enough lipid molecules and you start changing the shape of the cells, and start creating gaps in the tissue matrix allowing the alcohol to seep deeper into the tissue and begin interacting with nerve cells; thus the burning.  If the alcohol is only briefly present, what little amount there is will be used up fairly quickly, and diluted or washed away by other events, and the tissues can patch themselves up fairly quickly (cell repair happens a lot faster than cell replacement).
Alcohol and bacterium sanitation go through similar processes with a couple different caveats.  Alcohol doesn't just act as a denaturing agent; it is also an osmotic agent.  Osmosis is the phenomenon of water moving from areas of high water concentration to low water concentration.  Salts are the most familiar osmotic agent more people are aware of; but ethanol will also attract water very strongly.  It's why you can never distill ethanol up to 100% without special lab equipment.  Ethanol will straight up pull water out of the air if given the chance.
In the event of using alcohol on bacteria, osmosis and denaturing have to work in concert.  If denaturing happens to quickly, the bacteria's membrane gets ""burned"" and essentially seals up in response to the attack.  The bacteria isn't destroyed and simply waits for the environment to be conducive to it's survival, then regenerates.
If that denaturing process is slowed down though, the membrane doesn't seal into a shell, and gaps and cracks remain, so then the water inside the bacterium is drawn out through the osmotic force, into the low-water alcohol.  If enough water is drawn out, the bacterium essentially collapses and the ""cellular"" elements inside of it are spilled out.
It's why all the hand sanitizer and such is between 60 and 70% alcohol.  It's more effective at killing bacteria and viruses than 90 or 99% alcohol because the water content is necessary for the osmotic pressure and slower denaturing.
Oh.  Mucosa is also replaced quickly.  If you were to sit there and just swirl around some alcohol for like ten minutes, shortly after you would start noticing a residue forming in your mouth.  The residue would be sloughed off mucosal cells and tissue that was sufficiently damaged and killed by the alcohol.  But within a day, if not less, you wouldn't know much happened.  The wounds that take time to heal are the wounds involving the sub-mucosal tissues.
So, teal-deer, alcohols and Tide Pods have a shared love of lipid bilayers.

And Microraptor, a smaller cousin of Velociraptor, had full-on wing feathers, plus long leg feathers and a small feathery fan on its tail.
When feathers aren't preserved in a fossil, other evidence may tip off paleontologists to the likely presence of feathers. Quill knobs, bumps on arm bones where feathers attach, have been found in several dinosaurs (including Velociraptor itself). In addition, if a certain dinosaur has no direct evidence one way or the other, but has close relatives with confirmed feathers, it can be reasonably assumed it had them too. This is akin to how extinct cats are depicted with fur because all their modern cousins have it.

Let's start with bones first.
From the way bones are constructed, we can tell if they have to support heavy weight like an elephant, or let the animal climb a tree like a squirrel, or allow the animal to unhinge its jaw to swallow very large prey like a snake, or show lots of evidence where tendons were firmly anchored to them that indicate an animal with massive strength like modern gorillas. Worn-down and scratched up flat teeth might indicate a grazer that ate a lot of grit.
Then there's the chemical composition in those bones. Certain trace chemicals can teach us about the animal's diet, or about its health. Was it malnourished? Did it live long? And so on.
But there's TONS of other stuff too. Those bones could be found with smaller bones of the creatures that were in the animal's stomach or that passed through into its dung. Its footprints could have been preserved in mud and teach us how long its stride was while walking or running. Certain types of skin and hair are very often preserved too. 
So we add it ALL up, and compare it to what we know about modern animals for similarities, and there ya go.

y6z3nm,https://www.reddit.com/user/EntangledPhoton82,21,"Thousands of years ago is easy.
Changes are high that you'll have a lot of their descendants living today.
By observing them, noting the differences between de descendants and the earlier versions and making comparisons to other animals alive today you can make excellent educated guessed.
Further more, you might have other types of evidence such as footprints, human drawings of the animal, descriptions,...
And finally, you might even be able to get DNA samples or find partially preserved remains.
If we're talking about animals that lived millions of years ago then we still use the same principles but we just don't have the same abundance of data.
But we could for example extrapolate that a dinosaur and a Casuarius  that share similar legs and pelvic design would have walked in a similar fashion. If we then find fossilized imprints of the dinosaur's feet and compare them with those of a Casuarius (stride length, spacing,...) then we might use that to confirm or correct our assumption.  
This is of course a very brief description about how we can formulate rational assumptions by combining multiple pieces of information; both ancient and modern. So, just understand that it's much more complex then a brief explanation can do justice.

All animals with skeletons follow the same universal body plan, and how the bones go together is well known. Wear and tear on the bones shows what stresses they were put on when alive - from that we can calculate weight, habits, behaviors and movements.
But there is always more than just bones. Imprints of skin and soft tissues in the rock tell even more, as well as traces of proteins and DNA that survive intact. Add in parts trapped in amber, or preserved in peat or other chemical laden preserves, and even more can be known. In some cases, such as the Wooly Mammoth, entire animals were perfectly preserved in ice - explorers have literally eaten their meat.
For even older creatures - try tens of millions instead of thousands of years, such as dinosaurs - there are now examples of tails, with feathers, preserved in amber. We know exactly what dinosaur feathers looked like thanks to that. We can recover the color pigments of their feathers, skin and eggs (eggs tended to be blue-green, their feathers every color including neon shades like parrots, and skin, various browns and tans).

The reason they become weightless isn't because there is no gravity in orbit. In fact, it's gravity that's pullingkeeping them around in an orbit in the first place. The reason they become weightless is that they're in free-fall. 
That moment where your stomach turns on a roller coaster is the same effect - briefly - you're able to match the acceleration due to gravity and feel no weight. There is a specialist aircraft called the ""Vomit Comet"" used to train astronauts that creates long periods of freefall in a purpose built aircraft. 
Spacecraft are moving sideways so fast that despite them falling towards the Earth, they continue to miss it. This occurs at around 7.5 kilometres per second or about 5 miles a second in the old money. 
On re-entry things are a bit more interesting. 
Gravity slowly climbs as the pressure of the air against the returning vehicle counters the acceleration due to gravity. With space capsules there are period of intense G as the airpressure outside dramatically slows the capsule. With the Spaceshuttle, it's quite a gentle affair as 1G returns on transition to gliding flight.

With that said most people get used to microgravity but there are some constant effects like your face is always a bit swollen due to your legs squishing the blood up to your head too hard (that feeling you get in your eyes if you hang upside down on the monkey bars).
Thats also why spicy foods are popular on the station as blocked sinuses are common.

Spacecraft are moving sideways so fast that despite them falling towards the Earth, they continue to miss it. This occurs at around 7.5 kilometres per second or about 5 miles a second in the old money. 

Just to make sure there isn't any confusion on this point, that number changes depending on how high you are about the planet. You can't get 30m off the ground moving 7.5km/s horizontally and expect to sail continually over the horizon, and the moon, being much higher above the surface of the Earth, is moving at roughly 1/7th of that speed to maintain its orbit.

yu6rv5,https://www.reddit.com/user/Sima_Hui,5,"Weightlessness is the same thing as free-fall, and weight (or gravity as we perceive it) is just acceleration. This is the weird idea that Einstein discovered when he developed General Relativity. Being in orbit, ""simulating"" weightlessness in an airplane, plummeting to the ground inside an elevator with a snapped cable, and floating ""weightless"" in deep space, are all identical situations gravitationally. 
As I said, ""Weight"" is just the sensation of acceleration; whether that acceleration is from the Earth pushing against you, or from a rocket engine pushing against you instead, you're experiencing the same phenomenon. This is a concept that flat-earthers misunderstand when they co-opt it to justify how things ""orbit"" in circles above the ""disc Earth"" they envision. Technically, there is a sliver of truth when they say that the Earth is accelerating ""upwards"" at 9.8 m/s2. But that's not really it. 
Here's the weirdest part. General Relativity says that the natural state of motion for any object is to travel in a straight line at constant speed through four-dimensional spacetime. Anything we perceive as not travelling straight isn't due to a change in the object's motion, it's due to spacetime curvature that exists in a fourth dimension we can't perceive and which is caused by massive objects. Anything with mass curves the spacetime around it. So what we perceive as a curved path due to gravitational pull is actually a straight line in curved spacetime. An astronaut experiencing ""weightlessness"" in a circular orbit in three dimensions is, bizarrely, just travelling straight in four dimensions. Standing on the surface of the Earth, your body is trying to go straight through spacetime, but the Earth is in the way. The Earth is also trying to go straight, but you are in the way. The result is a force that you and the Earth apply to one another, an acceleration, that constantly pushes you out of a straight 4D line, which you perceive as ""weight"". The straight path of the Earth and your straight path intersect 4th-dimensionally, which to our 3D brains looks like gravitational attraction.

That moment where your stomach turns on a roller coaster is the same effect - briefly - you're able to match the acceleration due to gravity and feel no weight. There is a specialist aircraft called the ""Vomit Comet"" used to train astronauts that creates long periods of freefall in a purpose built aircraft.

It's a good comparison, but doesn't really work for me.  If you're on a rollercoaster, as you feel weightlessness you are accelerating to match gravity.  As you accelerate, your velocity increases.  You can't extend that comparison to astronauts in orbit.  Things in orbit don't have their velocity increase.
The difference is on a rollercoaster your potential energy is being converted to kinetic energy.  That's awkward to think about as we stand here on the surface of the planet.  We're so accustomed to ""things falling"" being interchangeable with ""things moving faster"".  But it's really losing potential energy, not falling, that makes things accelerate.

I will take a moment to suggest you give Kerbal Space Program or (much less preferably) Simple Rockets a spin if you're at able. Both are reasonably accurate rocket and space flight simulations that don't get too bogged down with the ""sim"" aspect, and do an amazing job demonstrating the basic principles of space travel and aerodynamics.
KSP's career mode will walk you all the way from a glorified bottle rocket to complex multi-stage planetary expeditions if you stick with it, but even if you only play it for a few hours, you'll get to experience the process of getting a rocket into orbit and why it's so much more difficult than it seems.
One of the first things you learn in KSP is that gravity is an ever present friend (or enemy!) and the way it's reach never leaves you, no matter how far out you travel.

yu6rv5,https://www.reddit.com/user/googlecansuckithard,-5,"First, remember the difference between weight and mass. Mass is the physical amount of matter in an object- we cant change mass without changing the object. When you loise weight on a diet, ypure really loosing mass. Weight is a measurment of the force of gravity upon mass - if we alter either the influence gravity (say the moons gravitational field of 1/12 that of earth)  or mass we alter weight. 
However  , the further away you are from an object, like a planet, the less that object's gravity can influence you. A sapcecraft stays in orbit because its horizontal velocity (the thrust force of the rocket)  is more than the velocity of the gravity of the object orbited. The horizontal velocity doesnt drop quickly because of inertia (objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by an intervening force). Left to its own devices, a spacecraft will eventually have its horizontal velocity slowed by gravity so much that it deorbits. The velocity of earths gravitational field is 9 m/sec. So if the horizontal velocity of the spacecraft drops below 9m sec. It will deorbit. 
Therefore, as you get further away from earth the closer you become to percieved weightlessness provided there is no intervening force to cause a positive G force, such as the thrust force of a rocket, such that we feel positive G force until the engine cuts off and then suddenly feel the lack of gravitational force all at once such that things begin to float. 
However, astronauts are never truly weightless because there is no such thing as zero gravity in nature. Rather they are in a microgravity environment because every object having mass has its own gravitational field in the absolute sense. (e.g. strictly speaking, we all have our own gravitational field in proportion to our mass and density) - though it takes something the mass of a planet before we can appreciate the effects of that gravitational field upon mass.

yu6rv5,https://www.reddit.com/user/left_lane_camper,4,"Spacecraft don’t de-orbit only because gravity pulls on them. If they are in orbit then the balance between the internal forces and the gravitational forces is exact. Gravity is conservative (neglecting gravitational radiation, but for something like a satellite in orbit this is entirely negligible. It would take trillions of times the lifetime of the the universe for the orbit of any satellite today to decay by that process). Orbital decay occurs because of aerodynamic drag, hence why low orbit decay quickly while higher ones effectively do not, and why larger objects decay more slowly than equivalently-shaped and dense smaller ones.
The free-body acceleration of gravity at the surface of the earth is about 9.8 meters per second squared. It’s not a speed and isn’t fundamental to the gravity or the earth, but only its approximate value at the surface.
The microgravity the astronauts in the ISS experience is primarily due to tidal forces and aerodynamic drag, not gravitational attraction to the station. When you are in pure free-fall and if you’re small enough to be well-approximated by a point mass you will be fully weightless.

Gauss’s law for gravity implies that at a radius r inside a spherically symmetric mass distribution the net force of gravity is only from mass at a radius less than r. So at the center of the sun, you would theoretically feel no gravity. Time dilation doesn’t come from the net force of gravity you feel, but from the differences in space time curvature at your reference frame (metric) and one outside of the gravity well. Your metric, while locally flat, is different from the metric of a reference frame in free space, and doing the GR tells us your clocks run slower relative to that reference frame in free space.
One of the big paradigm shifts of GR was recognizing that being in free fall in a gravitational field is indistinguishable from floating in space outside of the field. In both situations, you feel no force and you are in an inertial reference frame. But relative to each other, these frames have different metrics, and so converting your time and space coordinates between them leads to gravitational time dilation.

The gravitational field at the center of a uniform spherical body is indeed zero by symmetry. But gravitational time dilation is not based on the immediate local value of the gravitational field at one location. Time dilation is a relative measurement, so you have to define two locations: one at the center of the star, and one somewhere else - traditionally far from the star in flat, neutral spacetime: “at infinity.” The relative time dilation is based on the integral of the gravitational field along a path between those two points. Since the path passes outward through the mass of the star, the integral is negative. A clock at the center of the star would run slow relative to a clock located in the inter-galactic void.

yeevdf,https://www.reddit.com/user/CrzySunshine,1,"Yes. But the path between them does not have to be the “straight line” which goes “directly” between them. The integral of the gravitational field over any path connecting two points will always be the same, no matter what path you choose.
This is because the gravitational field is a conservative vector field, whose curl is everywhere zero. Gravitational fields only point directly towards mass, they can’t form a closed loop like the magnetic field around a magnet. This means that you can express the gravitational field as the gradient of a scalar potential. The gradient generalizes the idea of a “slope” to higher dimensions.
(Disclaimer: I am a physicist, but I use general relativity very rarely in my work, so I apologize for any inaccuracies from here on). In the static case, at every point in space the gravitational field has three components, g(x,y,z) = gx(x,y,z) x + gy(x,y,z) y + gz(x,y,z) z. (Bold here denotes vectors, with x etc. representing unit vectors). But if we can always write g as the gradient of a potential g(x,y,z), we’ve cut down the work by a factor of 3.
An interesting property of potential fields is that they are non-unique up to addition of a constant. That is, if f(x,y,z) = g(x,y,z) + C, then f = g. For most potentials, including the gravitational potential and the electrostatic potential, the traditional choice of C is such that the potential is zero very far away from any matter - “at infinity.”
It can be shown that the integral (along any path) of g from point A to point B is equal to g(A) - g(B).
So if you’ve chosen C so that your zero-potential reference point is at infinity, the gravitational potential at every point in space - g(x,y,z) - uniquely determines the gravitational time dilation experienced there, relative to some far-off observer. This is in contrast to the gravitational force, which is proportional to g(x,y,z), which is proportional to the gradient of g, not its value.
If you want to visualize this with the typical “rubber sheet” image of gravity, the force you feel is determined by the slope of the rubber sheet. The time dilation you experience relative to another observer is determined by the difference in your heights below the surface of the sheet when it’s pulled taut. At the center of a star, the slope is zero. But the star pulls the sheet down very far below its height at the edge.

yadcy1,https://www.reddit.com/user/just_commenting,870,"For the sake of argument, I'll assume that the speed guns in question emit a single pulse and look for a reflection.  I would expect actual operation to involve multiple pulses and some behind-the-scenes algorithms to detect a vehicle's speed.  Let's establish some parameters to start.

Wavelengths in the visible light spectrum are roughly between 380 to 700 nm.
LIDAR operates at either 905 or 1550 nm.
Radar speed guns operate in the Ka-band, which has a wavelength of about 1 cm, or 1,000,000 nm.

Musou Black published some specifications.  If you look at the reflectance plots, you'll see that the reflectance of Musou Black increases sharply once we're out of the visible range.  However, the plot only shows reflectance values of up to 2%, so we don't really know how well Musou Black performs at the wavelengths of interest.  Linearly extrapolating, the paint might fuzz a 950 nm lidar, but a vehicle would likely still reflect significantly at the license plate and headlights.  Higher wavelengths as with a radar-based speed gun would produce a much more significant returnreflection.  
In summary, coating your car with Musou Black might make it slightly more difficult for it to register on a speed gun, under certain circumstances ... but I wouldn't recommend relying on that.

These Black 3.0 etc. paints are just highly emissive. You can have two colours with the same emissivity and they'd both absorb energy exactly the same.
The higher emissivity (0 to 1), the closer the material is to becoming a true black body (100% absorption). But the emissivity of a material isn't consistent across the entire wavelengths.  
Thermography is a good example, industrial IR cameras operate across a different wavelength than those used by firefighters. In firefighting applications, being tuned to the lower wavelengths allows them to more readily see through flames/smoke for possible survivors. But the typical industrial camera would just 'see' the flames as a solid object.

In real life it might deviate a bit from that, but the two would remain closely related, and being black is definitely about absorbing light. 
Being black is definitely about absorption, think of a fluorescent compound, absorbing at a given wavelength and emitting at a distinct wavelength through a non-thermal mechanism: definitely appears black when you look at it at the absorption wavelength. 
The opposite of black is not necessarily white (no absorption but full scattering, quite specific), it could be transparent (no absorption), like a window, or it could be a mirror (full reflection without scattering).

But I'd like to address your other statement - how can a new feature develop if it never existed before?
Eyes are a prime example of this. 
Cells react to light because light causes chemical reactions. They can't NOT react to light. Following or avoiding light is very useful - to find food or to avoid predators, to get to where things are better or away from things that are dangerous.
Over time, some cells do better than others, or are in the right place, and if that is useful for survival, mutations favor creatures with more useful light-reacting cells. This is the beginning of a retina.
Funny trick of physics: a pit is a great way to gather light, it is also a great way to determine the direction of light - like a light compass. Very useful. Mutations that make a pit around such  light-sensitive, proto-retinal cells give a survival advantage.
Deeper pits are even better, and if they get so deep that they leave just a tiny pinhole, well, you have what amounts to a 'pinhole camera' going on, and that allows imaging. Very, very useful, and even more survival advantage.
But pits can get stuff trapped in them. The animals who have transparent membranes over the pits - bits of skin that let light through - do better, so now you have a ball with a lens. The beginning of an eye. 
Keep following this basic concept and, given hundreds of millions of years, you have eyes. From nothing more than skin cells.
That is how new features can develop 'from nothing'.

Just having mass, gives you energy, so ""pair production"" has a minimum energy cost.  But things are actually even more complicated than this.
The 'quantum foam' refers to a concept of the vacuum of space where the vacuum has a small, but nonzero energy by virtue of its existence.  Even if this energy isn't enough to 'afford' the production of matter antimatter particle pairs, Heisenburg's Uncertainty Princple has some fun things to say about energy.
It states that some properties about quantum systems CANNOT be known alongside other properties, to a certain degree of accuracy.  The Position of a particle, and its Velocity, for instance, are two kinds of measurments that can't be known together to a certain degree of accuracy.
Another pair of measurements that follow this sort of restriction is Energy and Time.  John Wheeler proposed that things that happen on a short enough timescale, across a short enough distance, have a large amount of uncertainty to their energy and velocity- allowing the small, but non-zero, energy of the vacuum to 'spend' larger amounts of energy to create matter antimatter particle pairs, provided it 'returns' that energy in a short enough timeframe.
Matter-antimatter pairs have mass, which means they fundamentally have energy, so the energy of a system that creates them decreases, while they exist.  But, if they recombine and anihillate each other, they can return the energy of their existence back to the system that created them.  
Quantum foam allows this to happen when the vacuum of space doesn't have this minimum energy, so long as they recombine within a certain timeframe, essentially.  It's uncertain how 'real' this interpretation of events is.  But, quantum foam is measurablemeasurably real in some form or fashion as evidenced by the Casimir Effect.

Humans develop with fingers and toes bound by tissue so hands and feet look more like a paddle or flipper. At a certain point in gestation some of that tissue undergoes apoptosis, meaning the cells die and are sloughed off. That process results in our fingers and toes differentiating into digits. Incomplete apoptosis is not uncommon, leaving partially webbed extremities ( The tissue between my second and third toes on my right foot, for example, extends between those toes about twice the distance as all of my other inter-toe spaces.).
When considering the eye, the structure that seals it shut is the cornea and if you look at the structure of the cornea it is mostly collagen, a major component of skin. 
Accepting the premise that eyes evolve from flat, light sensitive cells, into light sensitive pits, and so on, it's not difficult to hypothesize that at some point a species undergoing gestation experienced incomplete apoptosis of the outer layer of cells covering a primitive eye-pit, or that the outer layer of the pit de-laminated and stayed on the surface as the pit formed. From there you have a primitive cornea with tissue stretched thin enough to allow light passage.

It turns out that the protein used to refract light in the vertebrate eye is a protein which existed before the evolution of the lens. It is related to a protein which serves to mitigate the effect of heat in denaturing other proteins. It turns out that said protein happens to have the right properties to be useful in refraction of visible light, so when a mutant or mutants arose with a genetic variation which caused them to produce the protein on the surface of their eye, they had some primitive ability to focus light, which would have provided a substantial competitive advantage. And then any further variations, for example in the structure of the protein itself, that made the ability to focus light better, would have provided still more advantage.

The examples are generally driven by sexual selection, where it is made preference which drives the development and maintenance of seemingly counterproductive traits. Nobody can tell you exactly what goes on in the mind of a peahen but the typical just-so story is that because the tail of the peacock is so terrible for the success of the peacock in so many ways - it requires a lot of resources to grow and maintain; it makes moving around more difficult; it is quite obvious to predators - that, by selecting for peacocks with ever more ostentatious tales, the peahens are also indirectly selecting for peacocks which are so physically fit and able that they can survive despite the encumbrance of their ridiculous tail.
As you can see from the peacock and a myriad of other examples in the present day, an individual trait doesn't have to be adaptive in itself to survive and to spread. All it needs is to be one of the traits of an organism which is, because of their constellation of physical traits, able to outbreed competitors. Genghis Khan was almost certainly not a perfect physical specimen whose genome was most adaptive for human environments like those into which he was born. But because of his success as an individual in reproducing, his genes are grossly overrepresented in much of Eurasia. That very likely includes genes which were maladaptive at the time, and it very likely includes genes that are maladaptive now.

A radical, new mutation that pushes an organism towards a global maximum fitness over a lower local maximum would be favored by evolution. 
As a simplistic example, consider the giraffe. Neck length on the x-axis and fitness on the y. Imagine that this function has two maxima: a lower fitness maximum with short neck and a higher fitness maximum with long neck and a local minimum between them.
Now, assume that for the niche that the ancestors of the giraffe inhabited their shorter neck offered the local maximum fitness on the neck length-fitness landscape. Their descends had variations of the neck size, some a bit shorter, some a bit longer, however, as they offered lower fitness than the original neck, they would not be favored by evolution.
One day, an animal with a much longer neck, a giraffe, was born that could now graze on the foliage. This radically longer neck pushed the giraffe over the valley in the neck length-fitness curve and allowed to reach the higher fitness maximum. This mutation would now be favored by evolution.
I imagine this be the case with a nostril or a blow hole.

Sense organs (and the brain tissue to process them) cost a LOT. That is a big deal in evolutionary terms, and it is why we, for example, don't have three or more eyes ourselves. It is also why blind cave fish lost their eyes entirely.
A mutation that happens to be good for survival, but which costs too many calories to maintain - say the animal cannot realistically get enough food to power the organ - won't be maintained. All life exists on an energy budget - even plants and bacteria.
Cave fish evolved away their eyes (and the brain matter to process images) took too many calories. Cave fish get very little food - only what blows in from outside and manages to fall into the pool where they are. There is no light, so eyes are useless and a constant drain on their energy. Fish with smaller and smaller eyes did better, and no eyes at all was selected for. The blind, uncaring engine of evolution removes just as easily as it gives.
Sometimes things get stuck in an evolutionary dead end - just good enough, no pressure to get any better. It may be that pit vipers infrared pits are 'just good enough'. Evolution isn't trying to do or make anything. It is a machine. It doesn't care.
One example of this in humans is our appendix. It used to be a crop - just like a bird, or rather a dino (which were birds) - an organ where swallowed rocks would grind our food. But that is useless in an animal with teeth to chew, so the appendix - our crop - was selected against. It used too much energy without purpose or value.
But - there came a point where it was 'good enough'. Some people, throughout history, have died from appendicitis. The shrunken, vanishing appendix gets something stuck in the tiny hole, becomes inflamed, bursts, and kills the person. But so few die this way, statistically, that it doesn't matter. If the appendix shrunk any more, in order to vanish entirely, then many people would start dying as it closed off, became inflamed, and killed them. So there is a limit to how small it can get without killing people - and thus evolution has just stopped trying to get rid of it.
The cost is very tiny, if it got smaller too many would die, and therefore we are stuck with a dangerous, useless organ. It is useless, so it won't get bigger. It is dangerous and can't get smaller. Stuck. Frozen.
And, though it doesn't apply to evolution at all, the appendix may even have a use for modern humans in one weird way - the bacteria inside it is hidden from most antibiotics, so it helps repopulate the gut when we have to take them. That wasn't an issue for all of time until just recently, and it doesn't have any evolutionary value at all, but it is kind of nice that a completely useless organ might be just a tiny bit useful  in our technological age of antibiotics.

In reality, most of the protein is just structural, and each triplet of bases corresponds to an amino acid, with tons of synonymous substitutions and substitutions for functionally identical amino acids (e.g. polar for polar).  Only a few of the actual bases really control whatever it is the protein actually does (binding rate, ligand affinity, etc.).  The per-base mutation rate for humans is around 1*10^-8.

So there are 3n encodings, where n is the number of extant isoleucine codons, which are redundant and therefore equivalent to the original encoding in terms of function, which is what's actually selected for. There is even more redundancy for other codons. Arginine is encoded by 6 unique codons, so in addition to the 3n isoleucine variants, you have 6m arginine variants, where m is the number of arginine codons; leucine also has 6 codons, and so does serine. In fact, only two of the 22 canonical amino acids have a unique encoding. 
In addition to this massive assortment of functionally identical alternate encodings, there are even more functionally very similar alternative encodings. Depending on the exact mutation, an amino acid can sometimes be replaced by another amino acid with very similar physiochemical properties which don't alter the ultimate function of the expressed protein. Even more of them will only alter function in minor ways that don't significantly impact fitness.
On top of all of this, not all of the gene actually encodes proteins. Many mutations that occur within non-coding regions can be expected to not alter the function of the gene. 
The bottom line is that although your number of potential combinations of base pairs is astronomical, so is your number of potential combinations of base pairs that encode the same, or a functionally equivalent, gene.

A blowhold on top of the head is really nostrils equivalent to our nose.

Perhaps it allowed them to exchange gases easier, without need to lift their eyes out of the water (better to keep eyes on prey/predators).

Everything with regards to evolution comes down to competitive advantage. Picture a muskrat, for example. You can easily see how this creature might have an advantage over other muskrats if it didn’t have to raise its head out of the water to breath as it searches for food. Whales evolved in such a way that their ancestors spent more and more time in the water, slowly developing the appropriate suite of traits. 
Simply put, the whale didn’t manifest a new feature, it just moved its nostrils from the anterior end of the animal to its mid-dorsal region.

Fish use a fantastic method of maximising oxygen uptake in water - a comparably hypoxic environment to air, as noted above.

This maintains the gradient of oxygen within and outside of the lamellae to increase the rate of oxygen diffusion into blood. see this diagram! https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTCwVqjvP0p7cdfAYILZkv1yyNwwhfD_jh7AA&usqp=CAU

For example, insects used to be much larger than today because higher O2 concentrations in the atmosphere allowed oxygen to permeate deeper into their tissue. Under current conditions it is impossible for insects to exist at the scale they once did.
Evolution also doesn't have an inherent trajectory towards ""better."" We tend to think so, because we see ourselves as a sort of apex of evolution and imagine that life should evolve to become more intelligent, complex, and competent. And the obvious lessons of evolution tend to support this idea - survival of the fittest for example. But in reality evolution is a random process that branches in unexpected and often untenable ways. Genetic lineages, despite remarkable adaptations, can be rendered extinct by some essentially random event. Nothing is bound to evolve in a particular direction, and sometimes particular sub-optimal features persist because there is no pressure for it to be ""better"" or even ""useful.""

For example: crabs can only grow so large, because they must moult their shells to grow and they maintain their structure and shape in their soft intermediary period through hydrostatic pressure. This works great at their actual size, but beyond a certain size will cease to be effective: the crab body with flop and bend and flex, and harden out of shape. Another limit for arthropods generally is the fact that their skeletons are external, making their limbs essentially tubes. Doubling their size cubes their mass but only squares the strength of their legs. Thus weight will swiftly outstrip carrying capacity.
Neither of these problems can be solved without radically altering the fundamental nature of the arthropod body plan, and there is no path to get there. There's also no impetus: they are the best at what they do within their current parameters. There is no selective pressure forcing them out of it.

One is the scale on which it operates. Which isn't surprising as it's way, way, way beyond anything we could ever have a frame of reference for. The changes only need to be miniscule because they can accrue over thousands of generations.
The other is that you can get sudden big leaps in evolution through more dramatic mutations. Again, because of the sheer number of instances, even though the vast majority of major mutations will lead to a dead-end, it only takes one in a million/billion to provide some kind of overall advantage. Even if that advantage wipes out other beneficial traits, as long as the chance of passing on the mutation increases overall, then it has a chance of out-competing other genetic lineages.

yrrlu7,https://www.reddit.com/user/MountainBrains,1,"Think about some intermediate steps. The ancestor of these species was a land animal that presumably spent a long time in the water. I imagine that animal needed to look underwater while swimming on the surface. Wouldn’t it be convenient if your nostrils were really far apart so that you didn’t have to turn your head so much to breath? You could keep looking down while also breathing. Even farther apart and you don’t even have to turn to breath. Dolphins are predators, but their eyes are on the side of their head. It isn’t a hard and fast rule, but most of the time predators have forward facing eyes to track their prey. If a dolphin ancestor had to turn their head to breath while still looking for prey, it would make sense that their eyes could drift farther apart too. 
The point is that an opening like a blowhole could “drift” over time based on the environment. It could have been the side of their mouth the at some point became a separate opening entirely. 
Going even farther back, it could have been an air bladder from the sea creature that was the ancestor of the land-proto-dolphin that opened up when they started spending a bunch of time in the shallows, was retained during the land animal stage, and then happened to be great for when they went back to the water. 
Im sure someone could follow the gene lineage if we sequenced enough creatures. Then we could rule out some of the possibilities, but for now we have to be satisfied remembering that it might not always have been a structure that had that purpose  (the porpoise purpose), it could have been something totally different in a totally different place that drifted and was reshaped to do a job that was necessary.
